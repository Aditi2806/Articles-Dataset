How did they receive it?I imagine you haven’t mentioned it to them — because your comment is so entirely shameful that you truly could not confidently say this same sh*t to the women you love in your life.So what makes it in any way appropriate to say something so disgraceful to women online?Consider the women in your life for a moment… consider that 1/3 of those women who you truly love have been sexually assaulted.And your words directly shame these survivors.Give that a little thought for a quick second.There are plenty of things that I would like to type out to you, that I cannot publically put into words.But in a Twitter DM, with two other survivors, I can assure you that the depths of your depravity were discussed in detail, and we’ve got opinions about garbage people like yourself.You’ll never read this, because I blocked your sorry a** so fast after receiving this infuriating comment that I got whiplash.This is why safe communities for survivors and women are so damn important.Because people like you exist in the world — and we have a right to thrive in this space and tell our stories without your sickening abuse.Here’s hoping we never cross paths, ever again.Never miss a single beat — sign up for my monthly newsletter to get the scoop!👉 https://bit.ly/33XgtKTWritten by They additionally appreciate that there is more to you than just a body, and said body does not exclusively exist for their sexual satisfaction.Based on your theory, I should have been sexually assaulted at least 3 times, by each of my partners.And yet, 2/3 of them did not try to rape me.In fact, I communicated the boundaries of my sexual activity, and the 2/3 in question replied:“Yeah, sure, of course. I’ll let his words explain the essence of who he is:Do this:For months, take a steak and put it in front of a big dog’s face, but right when the dog tries to grab it from your hand, pull it away.Do that at least three times a week for 3 months.Tell me how long it takes for that dog to continue pursuing that steak after you’ve pulled it away.Y’all know I’ve got some sh*t to say, so let’s get right to it.They have done absolutely nothing to validate that they deserved or asked for the deep violation enacted against them.They are not in charge of taking any semblance of responsibility for the depraved and selfish behaviour of others.Insinuating anything otherwise is absolutely incomprehensible and disgusting.I’m also going to explain the simple concept of what a healthy, functional romantic relationship looks like, coming from a woman who has both existed in an abusive relationship in the past and currently thrives in a fantastic and supportive marriage:When a partner truly respects you as a human being, they also respect your consent. Whether or not they choose to exercise that self-control in ways that are morally right is a conscious decision — a decision which, when morality is ignored, rightfully comes along with consequences.Women who choose to exercise their basic human right to indicate their consent are not in charge of managing and accommodating for the sexual urges of grown a** adult men.F*ck right off.I even resent calling you “sir”.Frankly, I’d rather call you a “steaming pile of garbage”.Oh look, I just did it.\n","Article Heading:  The Biggest Surprise For Us Out Of Trump’s Impeachment Trial\n","Generated Summary:\n","Hillary Clinton actually did, up until then-FBI Director James Comey came out and announced a second email investigation, just a few days before the election.

Let’s evaluate how our model has performed with its predictions on the test data. SHAP dependence plots are similar to partial dependence plots, but account for the interaction effects present in the features, and are only defined in regions of the input space supported by data.

For the same reasons U.S. doctors haven’t publicly protested against electronic health records, they’re unlikely to do the same for smart technology.Besides, they can’t deny that many of the new smart devices can save them precious time. The team also made sure their device could hold up in hospital conditions. The hospitals hoped it would cut down the significant amount of time medical practitioners spent dealing with non-urgent patient queries, while raising patient satisfaction with their standard of care — and it did.The global smart hospital market, which encompasses medical devices interconnected through the Internet of Things (IoT), together with medical applications of A.I. These smart devices include surgical tools that give real-time feedback to the operator, a sensor-equipped feeding system for premature babies, and even the wearables patients walk into hospitals with.These technologies have vast potential to streamline workflow for already overburdened doctors and nurses, but there’s one big problem: Medical professionals are conflicted about whether to trust them.“I think they feel burned by electronic medical records.”A 2016 survey by Medscape, a health information resource for medical professionals, showed that in the United States, doctors were significantly more reluctant than patients to adopt new technology into their practices.\n","Article Heading:  That Good Ol’ Fashioned Grey-Area Depression\n","Generated Summary:\n","That in owning the title, you also have to own the nebulous persona that comes with it.But depression isn’t a persona.

That palpitation-hearted, fire-chested person?It’s a strange thing — to care so much about every detail, to require medication to ward off the excessive, destructive worry — only to turn around and not care about anything.The depression I was accustomed to involved a lot of kicking and screaming.\n","Article Heading:  The Question ‘Pro-Lifers’ Refuse to Answer\n","Generated Summary:\n","Support for legal abortion is at an all-time high, despite Republican efforts to quash access to the procedure, and the pro-choice Women’s March was the largest protest in American history.We also know that banning abortions won’t actually stop people from having them; it just makes desperate women seek more dangerous options.This historic support for Roe is part of the reason that anti-abortion politicians and activists have been lying so much lately — claiming that there are “post-birth abortions,” for example — instead of talking about the everyday realities of abortion. When the protesters left, the truth was still there.Written by Thousands of people descended on Washington, D.C., on Friday to protest the Roe v. Wade anniversary and hear Donald Trump voice his support for anti-abortion legislation.“Unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House,” said Trump, who is the first president to ever address the anti-abortion march. Or that women who are denied abortions are more likely to live in poverty.We also know that banning abortions won’t actually stop people from having them; it just makes desperate women seek more dangerous options. “When it comes to abortion… Democrats have embraced the most radical and extreme positions.” Following his speech, Trump was greeted to chants of “four more years.”Yet what the march failed to acknowledge — and what anti-abortion activists always fail to acknowledge — is that their views are being increasingly minimized.\n","Article Heading:  My Heartfelt Advice to Any Woman Having an Affair with a Married Man\n","Generated Summary:\n","These are women who are searching for solace and for closure.So many women who have written to me asking for advice feel trapped in agony wondering how they got to this dark place and trying to figure out a way to extract themselves without causing or feeling even more pain than they already have.Well, I have advice for any woman out there who has found herself in the regrettable position of being the “other woman.”My advice is to walk away.I know you’re afraid of feeling more pain but the pain of staying with someone who most likely will not divorce their spouse or change their life in any way to suit your needs will end up being far worse down the road.I know this is probably not what you want to hear. It wasn’t what I wanted to hear way back when and I let myself live in shame and denial for years while holding my own life hostage for the needs of someone who was not being faithful to the person they promised themselves to.The more you choose to live in the bubble of denial and the more you convince yourself that perhaps this person will change or leave their spouse for you, the more you deprive yourself of a life you deserve to live without the secrecy, without the tears, and without this burden following you around.You are not a wicked person. It’s not something I’m proud of but it’s something I choose not to feel shame for anymore, especially after all these years.However, along with that article came an outpouring of stories and experiences from other women about their own affairs with married men. It doesn’t mean you’re not pretty enough, exciting enough, or any of those things you may think to yourself.The problem ultimately lies with the person who is betraying their partner and my heartfelt advice to you is to stop participating in that betrayal with them.There is nothing that an affair can fix either for the spouse who is cheating or for the woman with whom he is cheating.Though the sensational allure of lust and the thrill of secret sex can be intoxicatingly addictive, that does and WILL fade over time.And so, my advice to any woman reading this who finds herself in the situation I have described, I again implore you to extricate yourself, cut ties, change your number, do whatever it takes to save your own future.As someone who wasted years away pining for someone who could not love me in a healthy, functional way, this is my heartfelt and sincere advice.More from Michelle: What I’ve Learned About Serial CheatersWritten by The response was overwhelming.The women who have reached out to me are not heartless women.\n","Article Heading:  How To Handle Other People’s Bad Moods Like a Pro\n","Generated Summary:\n","They’re frustrated, angry, a little bit anxious, and there’s no sign of it letting up. While you’ve been able to tolerate it for the past couple hours, you feel yourself starting to get annoyed with them.Rather than a) acting on this annoyance and saying something unhelpful to your spouse, or b) becoming judgmental of yourself for feeling annoyed with them, you could validate your own annoyance.You could pause for a few seconds, acknowledge that you’re feeling annoyed and frustrated with your spouse, remind yourself that it’s okay and natural to feel that way, and then ask yourself what the most helpful way to move forward might be.A common pitfall I see people make when trying to deal effectively with other people’s bad moods is to overextend their responsibility to that person to include how they feel.Let me unpack that a bit:In short, because you can’t directly control how someone feels, you’re not responsible for it.So much unnecessary struggle, conflict, and wasted energy comes from a fundamental misunderstanding about what’s really under our control.On the other hand, it’s amazing how much genuinely helpful energy gets freed up when you remove the burden of excess responsibility from yourself.When you stop expecting to be able to make someone feel better, you can start taking real steps to connect with them in a heartfelt way and become genuinely supportive.Bad moods and painful emotions are hard to handle — both in ourselves and also in the people we work and live with. And when we’re curious about another person’s emotion, it’s far easier to be validating, understanding, and empathetic, which is what most people experiencing strong, painful emotions really need.So, pay attention to your own self-talk when someone you care about is very emotional. Try to catch and hold back on thoughts like:And instead, substitute more curiosity-driven questions:When you shift from problem-thinking to puzzle-thinking, your mindset becomes driven by curiosity rather than morality, which is far more helpful in an emotionally-intense situation, both for you and the person across from you.When someone you care about is in a bad mood, try to understand how and why they’re feeling the way they are rather than how it can be fixed.Empathy is the act of putting yourself in another person’s shoes and trying to imagine what it must be like to live in their skin — with their thoughts, feelings, experiences, and circumstances.And while empathy is obviously an important skill to cultivate for all sorts of reasons, there’s a version of it that’s especially helpful for managing other people’s bad moods. This is why we often react to other people’s bad moods in a way that ultimately isn’t helpful to them, us, or the relationship.The solution is to get better at noticing and managing our own emotional responses early so that they don’t balloon out of control.\n","Article Heading:  Nootropics for Productivity, Relaxation, and Social Enhancement\n","Generated Summary:\n","I think it’s the brain game that has the strongest clinical evidence for it as being something that objectively measures working memory, cognitive performance, and executive functioning.

In fear for her safety, she checked into a hotel.On Monday, the Washington Post put Sonmez on administrative leave, noting in a statement that the paper was reviewing whether her tweets violated their social media policy, and saying that she “displayed poor judgment that undermined the work of her colleagues.”Her tweet, which was presented without comment, linked to a Daily Beast article from 2016 headlined, “Kobe Bryant’s Disturbing Rape Case.” She also tweeted about the thousands of people who responded with abuse and threats, and noted that it “speaks volumes about the pressure people come under to stay silent in these cases.”We can argue about when it’s appropriate to speak negatively about someone who has died tragically, and whether a person should be remembered by their worst moment. In fact, in a 2016 interview, Neil Irvin, the director of the nonprofit Men Can Stop Rape, said Bryant’s apology stood in stark contrast to other high-profile men’s responses to allegations of harassment or assault.“Kobe is the only accused individual who I’ve ever seen provide an apology in writing in my 16 years of doing rape prevention work,” Irvin said. After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.”A woman was punished — both personally and professionally — simply for drawing attention to a well-known allegation that reflected poorly on a beloved male celebrity.Bryant also noted that the woman was not paid any money and that he did not doubt her motives for bringing the accusation forward.The truth is that it was a remarkable apology, one that recognized at least some of the harm caused. Once the tweets were deleted and Sonmez had checked into a hotel, she found out she was being placed on leave; managing editor Tracy Grant told her in an email that her “behavior on social media is making it harder for others to do their work as Washington Post journalists.”How a tweet pointing to an accurate news story would make life difficult for other reporters is unclear.\n","Article Heading:  Top Google AI Tools for Everyone\n","Generated Summary:\n","By encouraging the use of its Cloud AI tools, Google is trying to boost the presence of AI and ML in the real-world.The purpose is to empower users with precise means of evaluating, collaborating, improving and deploying their tailored machine learning models for increased productivity and improved services.Hackernoon— TensorFlow is dead, long live TensorFlow!Flutter Community — Flutter +MLKit = ❤Towards Data Science— Getting Started With Google ColabData Science Central — https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/top-8-google-ai-toolsGoogle AI — https://ai.google/About AuthorClaire D. is a Content Crafter and Marketer at Digitalogy — a tech sourcing and custom matchmaking marketplace that connects people with pre-screened & top-notch developers and designers based on their specific needs across the globe.

You can easily answer this question by thinking back to when and how often someone said one of the following sentences to you:If this is stuff people say to you regularly, congratulations: You certainly know how to open up other people and connect with them deeply. Most people don’t expect others to solve their problems; if they do, they will ask for your advice specifically.
