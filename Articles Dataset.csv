0,9 Tips For Training Lightning-Fast Neural Networks In Pytorch,"Let’s face it, your model is probably still stuck in the stone age. I bet you’re still using 32bit precision or *GASP* perhaps even training only on a single GPU.😱.I get it though, there are 99 speed-up guides but a checklist ain’t 1? (yup, that just happened). Well, consider this the ultimate, step-by-step guide to making sure you’re squeezing all the (GP-Use) 😂 out of your model.This guide is structured from simplest to most PITA modifications you can make to get the most out of your network. I’ll show example Pytorch code and the related flags you can use in the Pytorch-Lightning Trainer in case you don’t feel like coding these yourself!Who is this guide for? Anyone working on non-trivial deep learning models in Pytorch such as industrial researchers, Ph.D. students, academics, etc… The models we’re talking about here might be taking you multiple days to train or even weeks or months.We’ll cover (from simplest to most PITA)You can find every optimization I discuss here in the Pytorch library called Pytorch-Lightning. Lightning is a light wrapper on top of Pytorch that automates training for researchers while giving them full control of the critical model parts. Check out this tutorial for a more robust example.Lightning uses the latest best practices and minimizes the places where you can make a mistake.We’ll define our LightningModel for MNIST here and fit using the Trainer.This is probably the easiest place to get some speed gains. The days of saving h5py or numpy files to speed up your data loading are gone (wait… you guys weren’t doing that?? ). With Pytorch dataloader loading image data is trivial (for NLP data, check out TorchText)In lightning you don’t need to specify a training loop, just define the dataLoaders and the Trainer will call them when needed.Another magical place for speed-up comes from allowing batches to be loaded in parallel. So instead of loading one batch at a time, you can load nb_workers batches at a time.Before starting the next optimization steps, crank up the batch size to as much as your CPU-RAM or GPU-RAM will allow.The next sections will focus on helping decrease the RAM footprint so you can continue to increase the batch size.Remember you’ll likely have to update your learning-rate again. A good rule of thumb is to double learning rate if you double batch size.In the case where you have maxed out your compute resources, and your batch size is still too low (say 8), then we need to simulate a larger batch size for gradient descent to provide a good estimate.Let’s say we want to get to a batch size of 128. Then we’ll do 16 forward and backward passes with a batch-size of 8 before doing a single optimizer step.In lightning, this is all done for you though. Just set accumulate_grad_batches=1.A simple place to blow up your RAM is not releasing the pointer to the computational graph by say… storing your loss for logging purposesThe problem above is that loss still has a copy of the graph. In this case, call .item() to release it.Lightning takes special care to make sure it never retains copy of the graph.Once you’ve maxed out the previous steps, it’s time to move into GPU training. Training on the GPU will parallelize the mathematical computations across the many GPU cores. The speed-up you get depends on the type of GPU you’re using. I recommend the 2080Ti for personal use and the V100 for corporate use.It may seem overwhelming at first but you really only need to do two things: 1) move your model to the GPU, 2) whenever you run data through it, put the data on the GPU.If you’re using Lightning, you don’t have to do anything to your code. Just set Trainer(gpus=1).The main thing to take care of when training on GPUs is to limit the number of transfers between CPU and GPU.If you run out of RAM for example, don’t move data back to the CPU to save RAM. Try to optimize your code in other ways or distribute across GPUs before resorting to that.Another thing to watch out for is calling operations that force the GPUs to synchronize. An example would be clearing the memory cache.If you use Lightning, however, the only places this could be an issue are when you define your Lightning Module. Lightning takes special care to not make these kinds of mistakes.Sixteen-bit precision is an amazing hack to cut your memory footprint in half. The majority of models are trained using 32-bit precision numbers. However, recent research has found that models can work just as well with 16-bit. Mixed-precision means you use 16-bit for certain things but keep things like weights at 32-bit.To use 16-bit precision in Pytorch, install the apex library from NVIDIA and make these changes to your model.The amp package will take care of most things for you. It’ll even scale the loss if the gradients explode or go to zero.In lightning, it’s trivial to enable 16-bit without having to modify anything in your model or do what I wrote above. Set Trainer(precision=16).Now, this is where things get really interesting. There are 3 (maybe more?) ways of doing multi-GPU training.Split-batch TrainingThe first way should just be called split-batch training. This strategy copies the model onto each GPU and each GPU gets a portion of the batch.In lightning, you can just increase the number of GPUs you tell the trainer about without having to do anything of the above.Split Model TrainingSometimes your model can be too big too fit in memory. For example, a sequence to sequence model with an encoder and a decoder might take up 20 GB of RAM when generating outputs. In this case, we want to put the encoder and decoder on separate GPUs.For this type of training, don’t give Lightning trainer any GPUs. Instead, put your own modules in the LightningModule on the correct GPUMixing bothIn the case above, both the encoders and decoders can still benefit from parallelizing each operation. We can get more creative now.Caveats to think about when using multiple GPUsIf you’ve made it this far, you’re now in the realm of training Imagenet in minutes! This isn’t as hard as you might think, but it might require a bit more knowledge about your compute cluster. These instructions assume you’re using SLURM on your cluster.Pytorch allows multi-node training by copying the model on each GPU across every node and syncing the gradients. So, each model is initialized independently on each GPU and in essence trains independently on a partition of the data, except they all receive gradient updates from all models.At a high-level:Pytorch has a nice abstraction called DistributedDataParallel which can do this for you. To use DDP you need to do 4 things:Pytorch team has a nice tutorial to see this in full detail.However, in Lightning, this comes out of the box for you. Just set the number of nodes flag and it takes care of the rest for you.Lightning also comes with a SlurmCluster manager to easily help you submit the correct details for the SLURM job (example).Turns out, that the distributedDataParallel is soooo much faster than DataParallel because the only communication it performs is gradient syncing. So, a good hack is to replace DataParallel with this even when training on a single machineIn Lightning, this is easy to achieve by setting the distributed_backend to ddp and setting the number of GPUs.Although this guide will give you a list of tricks to speed up your networks, I’ll explain how I think through finding bottlenecks.I break up the model into a few parts:First, I make sure I have no bottlenecks in my data loading. For this I use existing data loading solutions I described, but if none fit what you need, think about offline processing and caching into high-performance data-stores such as h5py.Next look at what you’re doing in the training step. Make sure your forward pass is fast, avoid excessive computations and minimize data transfer between CPU and GPU. Finally, avoid doing things to slow down the GPU (covered in this guide)Next, I try to maximize my batch size which will usually be bounded by the amount of GPU memory. From there it’s a game about distributing across GPUs while minimizing latency to effectively use a large batch size (for instance on Imagenet I might try to get an effective batch size of 8,000+ across many GPUs.)However, you need to be careful with large batch sizes. Consult the literature for your specific problem to see what people have gotten away with!AcknowledgmentsThank you to Jeff Johnson for awesome CUDA insights, and the Pytorch teams for their help with getting DDP to work (not to mention their awesome framework and documentation).

1,How To Become A One-Drink Wonder,"Anyone can publish on Medium per our Policies, but we don’t fact-check every story. For more info about the coronavirus, see cdc.gov.By Lauren BravoSo you managed to take a little time off drinking! Congrats! Strike up the band! Lie on the floor and let someone pour Malbec into your mouth through a funnel!But then what? Once the first hangover has cleared, what’s going to be the legacy of your abstinence?You may not want to go completely teetotal, but you also know you don’t want to slide straight back into your old habits either. Because what’s the point of surviving days of dusty sobriety if you aren’t going to make long-term change? You’d like to get a handle on your drinking before everybody else quietly gives up and you’re the only boozer under 40 left.On the one hand, life is short. But on the other… same. It’s quite a conundrum.The answer? My friend, you need to become a One-Drink Wonder. An ODW, as the cool Bumble bios will read one day.Not to sound too much like I’m recruiting for a cult, but I’ve been an ODW for years now and I’m here to tell you it’s possible — to go out, even out-out, have one drink and stop. It’s hard, but you can do it. It takes practice, sure; but then so did liking the taste of tequila.“If you are trying to drink less overall, then alcohol-free days are actually easier than the days when you just have one or two drinks — for the simple reason that self-control and decision-making skills often go out of the window after a couple of drinks,” says Rosamund Dean, author of Mindful Drinking: How Cutting Down Can Change Your Life. She’s right of course; once you’re in the pub or at the party, it can feel as though resistance is futile. Lead a horse to water, and you might as well make it a double.For those of us who live on a feast-or-famine seesaw, always either on the wagon or crashing dramatically off it, a balanced middle ground is the holy grail. Having one drink might not sound thrilling, but it gives you options between ‘on for a rager’ and ‘home on the sofa’. You don’t have to sacrifice your Saturday morning for the sake of Friday night. You can join in the fun and remember it afterwards. Trust me, I’m a lightweight.In the interests of transparency I should say that I’m a One-Drink Wonder by accident, not through iron-willed self-restraint. I became one at the age of 22, when horrible hangovers started to massively eclipse my enjoyment, and it’s taken until my 30s for my feeble alcohol tolerance to be seen as a special skill rather than a massive deficiency.But now, finally, people want to know the secret. And I’ve learned a few things in all my years of “Honestly, I’m fine with this lukewarm water!” and “No you were really funny last night, promise!” that I’d like to share, backed up with sound advice from some experts.Here are 10 steps to help you become a One-Drink Wonder. I only hope this goes some way to compensating for all the rounds I haven’t bought.This advice is designed for people looking to cut down their alcohol intake, not those concerned they have a serious alcohol problem. If you are worried about your drinking, please contact Alcohol Change UK or Drinkline on 0300 123 1110.1. Water, water everywhereThis is the most annoying advice, so we’ll deal with it first. Water. You know this. For god’s sake, water.More specifically, drink water before anything else. We all know the old adage about alternating booze with soft drinks — but realistically this just means you end up sloshing around with a liquid belly, tripping balls on sugar and caffeine. Instead, I find it’s more helpful to co-opt the Instagram coffee mantra: “But first, water.” When the waiter comes round for the drinks orders, have a water before you reach for the wine list. When you finally choose a picnic spot on a blistering hot bank holiday, drain a bottle of water before you open that cold, cold beer. Always deal with your thirst first. It rhymes so it must be true.2. Patience, child“For those who drink impulsively to soothe social anxiety, boredom or stress, I suggest creating a window of time between wanting to drink and actually drinking,” says Shahroo Izadi, behavioural change specialist and author of The Kindness Method: Changing Habits for Good.She recommends telling yourself that you can drink whatever you want, but in an hour’s time. “Not only does this reinforce that thoughts are alerts, not commands and that ultimately we are in control of our actions, but it buys you an hour when you’d otherwise be drinking.”3. Get your plan in place“It may sound boring but the better you plan for the obstacles that come your way, the more likely you are to succeed,” says Laura Willoughby MBE, cofounder of mindful drinking movement Club Soda. “It helps to use a tool like ‘WOOP’ — wish, outcome, obstacle, plan — before you hit the bar. Knowing why you are sticking at one or two drinks (your wish, and outcome) will help keep you motivated, and planning for the point where people encourage you to stay for one more (the obstacle) will mean you know what you will do instead with confidence.”So have your official speech prepared in advance — whether it’s “I have to get up early” or “I recently discovered I have a rare condition where a second beer could make my head explode.”4. Go hard, then go homeMy breakthrough moment as a One-Drink Wonder was learning to like the strongest, bitterest thing on the menu. If you’re naturally sweet-toothed this can take practice, much like training yourself to drink black coffee or liquidised kale — but while it might seem counterintuitive when you’re trying to cut down, hard liquor is this ODW’s secret weapon.For one thing, a punchy drink commands respect from a certain breed of dickhead; the kind who always refuses to order you a shandy, believing it to be charming banter. In an ideal world, the dickheads wouldn’t bother us. But in this world, sometimes it’s helpful to keep them at bay.For another thing, stronger drinks should last longer. It’s so much easier to slowly sip a negroni or a nice single malt over the course of an hour than it is to drain a G&T and not immediately want another one. It feels grown-up, wincing slightly at every swig like a 1940s detective.And finally, when you’ve paid a tenner for your drink, you should want to make every drop count. Woe betide the barman who clears my glass when there’s still a 50p dribble in the bottom.5. Quality over quantityA swish drink can also help you feel less deprived. “If I’m going out and I want to make sure I only have one or two drinks, I choose the nicest (most spenny) drink I can,” says Rosamund. “So I’ll have a glass of champagne, rather than prosecco. Or I’ll have the nicest red wine on the menu. Or maybe a martini, which I will sip and savour.”After all, cheap drinks are a false economy once you factor in the Uber home. And the Domino’s.6. Eating isn’t cheatingThis isn’t an ironclad rule, because ironclad rules rarely do anybody any good. But as a mere suggestion: don’t drink through dinner. Unless you’re in a tasting-menu-with-wine-pairings situation, truth is you might appreciate both the food and the booze more if you keep them separate. The chef didn’t toil over the flavour profile of each dish only to have you souse your tastebuds in house white.So have a drink before dinner, enjoy it, then say, “I’ll have another one afterwards.” It’s amazing how often ‘afterwards’ rolls around and you’re too full and happy to bother.7. Not sharing is caringWe’re lone wolves, the One-Drink Wonders. We march to the beat of our own bottle opener. And because there’s nothing more likely to make you drink more than you wanted to drink than paying more than you wanted to pay, ODWs don’t do sharing, or rounds.This is easier said than done, of course. We’ve all felt pressured into ordering a bottle in a fit of jolly camaraderie. But while being the “actually I’ll just have a glass” person can make you feel like a killjoy, it can also break the spell and allow everyone else to be honest about what they really want, too. Rosamund says: “I’ll tell my friends at the beginning of the night: ‘I’m only having one tonight, so think I’ll make it a martini.’ Often, you’ll be surprised how keen they are to do the same.”8. Hack yourself soberForgive me if this sounds a bit Silicon Valley, but: rather than thinking of cutting down your drinking as an exercise in self-denial, try to think of it as a positive modification. You’re applying booze carefully and cleverly, to get the best results.“See it as an opportunity to actually ‘optimise’ your drinking experience as opposed to controlling or punishing yourself,” explains Shahroo. “Some of my clients who have experience of taking drugs (such as ecstasy) in the past actually find it easier to learn to moderate their drinking by remembering that alcohol is a drug and they want to be enjoying the positive effects for as long as possible. This tends to mean they drink more slowly and in smaller amounts, to maintain the buzz that they most enjoy. They simply drink until they are feeling the benefits and either slow right down or stop entirely when they’ve reached that sweet spot.”9. Practice makes perfect“Most of us want to moderate because we can’t imagine not drinking at a club, with a meal or at a friend’s birthday. But until you have done some of those occasions without a drink in hand you will never know what it feels like and if it is possible,” says Laura. “Set yourself some missions to do some big nights out without drinking, and develop the skills to really pick and choose.”Once you’ve danced sober, dated sober, even survived a hen weekend sober (dare you), settling for just the one drink will feel like a better compromise. And as Rosamund points out, “If you are drinking less overall, you’ll find that all it takes is one or two drinks to get you nicely buzzy.”10. Tell yourself you can still get trashed from time to timeIf the idea of never being more than “nicely buzzy” again feels unspeakably dull, earmark the occasional future sesh in your diary, as a treat. On those nights you might say yes to a second, and a third, and a sixth, but only if and when you really want to. After all, as Oscar Wilde once wrote on a fridge magnet, everything in moderation. Including moderation.Originally published at https://www.refinery29.com.Written by"
2,Treat Yourself Like a CEO and You’ll Make 10x More Income,"As I wrote that headline, an old joke came to mind:A guy walks into his office wearing a full-on Spiderman costume.“Hey Dave, what’s with the costume?” his coworker asks.“You know what they say,” Dave responds: “Dress for the job you want, not the job you have.”Walking around as if you make 6-figures a year when you really make $10/hour won’t magically make you rich. (It’ll probably make you look like a moron.)This isn’t some feel-goody-fluff article about being positive. I tried being “positive” for a long time working dead-end jobs and being completely broke and unemployed, and it didn’t work at all.But when you treat yourself fundamentally different than you have before — really treating yourself differently — then yes, you can expect to see some significant changes in your income.The reason is simple: people respect genuine self-belief. You teach people how to treat you.If you let people know that you’re not someone who tolerates mediocrity, they’ll stop giving you mediocre opportunities. When you tell people that you only accept truly great opportunities, that’s what you’ll start to attract. You attract what you are — make sure you‘re attracting the right things.If you want to be something, then act like it.If you don’t want to be something, then stop acting like that thing.Tony Robbins once asked a crowd of thousands to imagine their door bell ringing. When they opened the door, he told them a “depressed person” was at the door.He then asked them to describe that person.The answers? Probably similar to yours: drooped shoulders, downcast, messy hair, a frown, a quiet voice, no eye contact.Then he asked them to imagine that a “happy person” rang the doorbell. What did that person look like?Big smile. Friendly eyes. Warm handshake. Raised chin, standing tall. Eye contact.Robbins then asked everyone to physically imitate “a depressed person” and “a happy person” for one minute — act “depressed” and act “happy.” Robbins asked them how they felt afterwards.The answer: it had a huge effect! Even a minute of acting like a “depressed person” made many people actually feel sad and helpless.Of course, this is very oversimplified — real Depression and anxiety are enormous, complicated issues that can’t just be “thought” away. But I’m trying to make a point:How you act determines how you are.In his autobiography, Arnold Schwarzenegger wrote:The only way you become a leading man is to treat yourself like a leading man, and work your ass off.When I first started writing, I treated myself like a completely amateur writer. I didn’t invest in any tools or training, I wrote inconsistently, and didn’t focus on providing any real value. As a result, I never made any progress.Years passed. Finally, I started treating myself like a true professional. I did what professional writers were doing — investing in themselves, experimenting, learning new skills, failing forward.So I started making serious investments in like myself, like buying a $500 writing course and reading dozens of books. I also started writing consistently, and focused on learning and creating, not entertainment. I tried new things. I ignored the mean comments and kept writing.Treating myself like a professional writer has gotten me enormous results. The other day, I emailed a best-selling author to ask for a book endorsement — because why not? They responded, and they’re endorsing my book!!Treat yourself like a professional. If you want be something, then act like it.“Pretend your time is worth $1,000/hr. Would you spend five of them doing extra work for free? Would you waste one on being angry?” -Niklas GökeYou have very few hours here on on this earth.Still, many people waste much of their time on pointless, low-quality activities that don’t help them reach their true goals — their mission.The truth is, most people value their time at far, far less than it’s worth.They say yes to things they have no business doing. They give away their talents, attention, and effort to others who take, take, take.They spend hours watching low-quality television and social media when they should be productive and effective.See, many people could be making a fortune (if they used their time well)…but instead, they give away their time in unproductive ways that leave them broke, unhappy, and stuck.But what if you placed a high value on your time?How would that change you? Your life? Your family? Your future?Imagine that an hour of your time is worth $1,000.What would your life look like?What people would you stop putting up with?What problems would you stop wasting time on?What things would you stop — and start — doing?Your results would be incredible. You’d become exponentially more productive, focused, and effective.“Most people have no clue what they are doing with their time but still complain that they don’t have enough.” -Grant Cardone, NYT best-selling authorLike I said, I spent years in writing mediocrity. Nobody read my stuff…because my stuff sucked. I didn’t invest any time or money into making myself better. Deep down, I knew I wasn’t a “professional.” So I treated myself like an amateur.Finally, I started taking myself seriously. And everything has changed since then.I get requests to be interviewed on podcasts, magazines, and blogs. The other day, I was asked to be a paid speaker at an international conference. Readers email me all the time telling me how helpful my content has been for them.Most days, I still have a hard time believing this is my life. Because for years, I was the one desperately begging people to notice me and my writing. No one ever did…until I started taking myself seriously.I don’t know exactly what will happen in your life when you start taking yourself seriously. But I can tell you this:Your life will change. And if you’re like me, any upgrade looks fantastic when you’ve spent years trying to make it.You teach people how to treat you.If you let people know your time is free and low-valued, people will treat it as such.But if you teach people that your time is expensive, important, and valuable, then people will respond in kind.What you think is what you become. If you think your time is worth a few bucks an hour, that you’ll begin to act like it. You’ll find yourself saying “yes” to meaningless, pointless obligations.But if, in your heart, you know your time is valuable…People will recognize that.People will respect that.People will treat you differently.Wrote author William Irvine:“People are unhappy in large part because they are confused about what is valuable.”Michael Jordan once said:You have to expect things of yourself before you can do them.If you believe you can can, odds are you probably will.But the opposite is also true — if you know you can’t, you’re probably right.Bruce Lee put it this way: “One will never get any more than he thinks he can get.” What you truly, deeply believe is true about yourself and your future is most likely what will happen.What do you believe?The problem is, most people don’t have powerful self-belief in themselves. Most people think this is about as good as it gets. For the most part, most people believe the best they can be is merely “good.”Why? Because it’s easier to stay in mediocrity than undertake the difficult process of upgrading your belief system. It’s easier to relax in “good” instead of busting your ass towards greatness.If you want to have an incredible, successful life, you need to begin believing success is the only possible option.If you want to increase your income, you should go to the source — you and your mindset. You can’t control customers, hiring managers, or people around you; you can control yourself and what you believe about yourself. All action stems from your belief. If deep down, you don’t think you can ever achieve true greatness…you almost certainly won’t.Upgrade your beliefs. Start treating yourself like a true professional. Start treating yourself seriously — you can be a force to be reckoned with, if you let yourself become that person.Once you start treating yourself like something bigger than you are now — a millionaire, a CEO, or whatever your goal is — you make that possibility much more real. Because you teach people how to treat you — start treating yourself like the thing you want to become.If you want to become extraordinary and become 10x more effective than you were before, check out my checklist.Click here to get the checklist now!Written by"
3,Bored? 7 Fun Things You Can Build,"There is no real secret when it comes to becoming a great developer. The thing that separates great developers from mediocre developers is the effort they’ve put in. Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts. Getting your hands dirty is what will make you grow as a developer.So while you’re on your way to becoming a fantastic developer, why not do it making something that’s actually fun to build?What’s fun to build? You’ve probably thought about this for a while. You want to build something but you don’t know what…well, let me help you out.In this piece, I’ll share seven projects with you that are both challenging and fun.This is a project I’ve been wanting to work on for myself for quite some time. When developing, I spend a lot of my time on web development. But software development is just so much more! If you like the combination of software and hardware this project is for you.This project aims to water your plants automatically. All you need for this is an Arduino (or Raspberry Pi), a moisture sensor, and a water pump. The goal is to write a piece of code that keeps your plants alive for as long as possible.What you’ll learn:Building Tetris is a great way to get a feeling of how games are developed from a basic perspective. If you want to make an app you could use Swift for this project. If you want to make this using HTML5, you could go for a JavaScript framework, like React or Vue.Things you’ll learn:Find the example GitHub repository here.Cryptocurrency has been a hot topic for a few years now. Despite this, there still aren’t many developers capable of writing smart contracts.Many blockchains that use smart contracts — the Ethereum blockchain currently being the biggest of them. The programming language that’s used for these Ethereum smart contracts is called Solidity.To get started with writing a smart contract you could start with a smart contract that sends transactions. If you want a more advanced smart contract, you could make one that functions as an escrow.What you’ll learn:You can find a great starting point for Solidity here.If you are new to the world of machine learning, then the classification of iris flowers is a great way to get a grasp of what machine learning is all about. That’s because this project is known as the “Hello World” of machine learning projects.The aim of this project is to classify iris flowers among three species (setosa, versicolor or virginica) based on measurements of length and width of sepals and petals. This project is perfectly suited being made in Python. All you need to get started is the data set.What you’ll learn:If you’re not the type of person that likes doing solo projects, you could always choose to contribute to open source. It might seem scary at first sight but there are lots of projects that could use a little help.If you don’t feel comfortable enough to submit pieces of code, that’s fine. Contributing can be as simple as checking a pull request.Pick a project you like and start helping people out!Here’s a good starting point if you want to contribute to an open-source project on GitHub.What you’ll learn:Creating your own trading algorithm is a project that requires a lot of finetuning. But before you can start building your algorithm you should do some research on trading strategies. Once you’ve got your strategy figured out, you can use a free stock API, like IEX Cloud, to check current the prices of your stocks.Let the algorithm run for some time and see how it performs. There are plenty of stock simulators you can use that will let you play with virtual cash instead of real cash.What you’ll learn:There are lots of out-of-the-box projects available when it comes to dashboards — but nothing’s as fun as building your own!This is one of the easier projects from this list. Very useful for developers who are just starting out. You can make this in basic HTML5 and CSS but if you want to go the extra mile, add React or Vue into the mix.What you’ll learn:It’s time to do some real work and have fun while you learn new things. These projects should keep you busy for quite some time. Picked one and just go for it!I would love giving you feedback on your project — I’m looking forward to seeing the results.If you can’t have fun, there’s no sense in doing it — Paul WalkerHappy coding!Written by"
4,First AI Model of the Universe Knows Science it was Never Taught,"A new 3D model of the Universe developed by an international team of researchers is fast, accurate, and makes predictions for which it was never programmed. Creators of the system have no idea how the Deep Density Displacement Model (D3M) is able to simulate changes in dark matter it was never taught to calculate.Artificial intelligence (AI) is modeling astronomical events from supernova explosions to the formation of exoplanets around alien stars. Now, researchers are harnessing the power of AI to model the Universe as a whole, with surprising results. As expected, the model quickly proved itself to be faster and more accurate than previous systems. However, without human operators training D3M to do so, the AI proved itself capable of describing models of the Universe with varying degrees of dark matter, baffling researchers.“It’s like teaching image recognition software with lots of pictures of cats and dogs, but then it’s able to recognize elephants. Nobody knows how it does this, and it’s a great mystery to be solved,” stated Shirley Ho, group leader at the Flatiron Institute’s Center for Computational Astrophysics and adjunct professor at Carnegie Mellon University.Our compliments to the M-5 unitOf the four fundamental forces of nature (gravity, electromagnetic, strong and weak forces), gravity plays the largest role, by far, in interactions between distant objects. Therefore, researchers developing the D3M system directed its focus to the effects of gravity on the Universe.Such models can require researchers to run thousands of simulations, and the most accurate models examine how billions of bodies behave over the age of the Universe.Investigators provided D3M with 8,000 of the most accurate simulations ever created. Neural networks ran calculations on the data, and researchers compared those results to their expected results.Following this training, D3M ran simulations on the behavior of virtual galaxies within a box measuring 600 million light years per side. While traditional faster models produce data in two to three minutes to complete, and more detailed scenarios take hundreds of hours to produce a result, D3M completed its task in less than 1/30th of a second.Faster models typically produce an error rate around 9.3 percent when compared to the best known results. In comparison, this new system produced a model with an error rate of a mere 2.8 percent.Researchers expected the speed and accuracy of their system to exceed that of previous models. What they did not expect was the AI to be able to carry out scenarios in which it had no training.Modeling the behavior of vast numbers of galaxies requires extraordinary computing power, and detailed simulations can take days to complete. Faster simulations, able to return results in a matter of minutes, lack some of the detail and accuracy possible with older, slower, models.The D3M model developed scenarios far more accurate than other models of the gravitational effect of gravity on galaxies, such as the second-order perturbation theory (2LPT).“We can run these simulations in a few milliseconds, while other ‘fast’ simulations take a couple of minutes. Not only that, but we’re much more accurate,” Ho stated.Computer simulations are utilized to model a wide range of astronomical scenarios, such as how galaxies would react if the amount of dark energy varies over time.Dark Matter poses a Heavy QuestionWhen we look out at the Universe, all the stars and galaxies we see does not come close to accounting for the effects of gravity. This finding was first discovered by Fritz Zwicky in the early 1930’s, and expanded by Vera Rubin four decades later.Today, we know that dark matter makes up roughly 27 percent of everything in the Universe, while all ordinary matter represents less than five percent of the total. The remainder — 68 percent — is dark energy, fueling the expansion of the Universe.The nature of dark matter, however, remains elusive.“Dark matter may not be made up of the matter we are familiar with at all. The matter that makes up dark matter could different. It may be filled with particles predicted by theory but that scientists have yet to observe,” NASA explains.As research continues, neural networks will become ever-more valuable to astronomers and astrophysicists seeking to uncover the nature of the Universe. This surprising new finding could assist researchers looking to advance both machine learning and artificial intelligence.I believe that at the end of the century the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted.” ― Alan Turing“We can be an interesting playground for a machine learner to use to see why this model extrapolates so well, why it extrapolates to elephants instead of just recognizing cats and dogs,” Ho remarked.Dark matter, along with dark energy, remains one of the greatest mysteries of the Universe. Artificial intelligence may prove essential in understanding this mystery — one of the most fundamental questions about the Universe that surrounds us all.Did you like this article?

5,10 Bad Habits of Unsuccessful People,"The first successful person I ever met — truly successful, with accomplishments I admired and ambition I strove to emulate — was an entrepreneur in his forties, a client of mine in the first real business I’d ever started. I was 24 and eager to learn; he was constantly cheerful, and had more money than he could count.We became close friends, and he told me eventually that he’d lost his wife, the love of his life, a half-decade before we met — the kind of loss, he said, that you never get over. It was a story that made his positive outlook seem all the more remarkable to me: Here was someone who had been through tragedy, and yet still made it a priority to do good things with his time and his money. He seemed to truly care about other people.Often, he’d tell me what he saw as the secret to his success: “I just try to avoid being unsuccessful,” he said. He studied what made someone (avoidably) unhappy, broke, or unmotivated — and then he avoided making the same mistakes.I knew in my bones that he was right. Too often, we adopt a plug-and-play attitude: “If I do x, I’ll be successful.” But if success was easy and predictable, we wouldn’t be seeking advice on how to achieve it. Instead of studying what’s worked for other people, I’ve followed my friend’s advice, paying close attention to the habits that hold people back from reaching their goals.Here are 10 of the most common self-imposed barriers. If you find yourself bumping up against one, use them as a signal to reevaluate, reflect, and reverse course.In his book Essentialism, time-management consultant Greg McKeown describes running into a former classmate who was between jobs and looking for career advice. Midway through the conversation, the man looked down at his phone and began typing.“Ten seconds went by,” McKeown recounts. “Then 20. I simply stood there as he continued to text away furiously.” After a couple minutes, he gave up and walked away.I think of this story whenever I feel pulled in many different directions, as a way of reminding myself to focus on the moment I’m in and the people I’m with. If that old classmate of McKeown’s had reminded himself the same thing, he might have made a connection or gotten a tip that led him to a job.“I’m training for a marathon.” “I’m starting a business.” You know what’s better than announcing something on social media? Doing it.In his 2010 TED talk, “Keep You Goals to Yourself,” entrepreneur Derek Sivers argued that broadcasting your plans can be counterproductive rather than motivating. People will often applaud you simply for stating your intention, he said, and somewhat counterintuitively, that applause can sap your will to actually follow through on the plans you’ve just outlined.“When you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it, psychologists have found that it’s called a ‘social reality,’” Sivers explained in his talk. “The mind is kind of tricked into feeling that it’s already done. And then because you’ve felt that satisfaction, you’re less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary.”There’s nothing wrong with sharing your joy. But try to hold your tongue until you’ve got good news, not just good intentions.The friends you surround yourself with can encourage you to be your best self, or they can bring out your worst tendencies. Do you have a goal to get healthier, for example? Hang out with people who will encourage you to make those changes in your life. Want to utterly fail in that goal? Spend time with ones who revel in their own bad habits. People feed off each other’s energy.As my friend showed me years ago when he told me about his grief, you can focus on the positive without pretending life is easy. You can have a realistic perspective without pointing out the bad in everything you see.We all know the person who complains about everything. “Ugh, it poured this morning, and my shoes got soaked.” Yes, that sucks. No, you can’t change the weather. You can put on a new pair of shoes.Having a bad day is okay — everyone gets irritable once in a while. But if you always hate everything, you’re having a bad life. It’s that simple.In college, I once asked a professor to extend a deadline for an essay. His reply: “I’m perfectly happy to extend your deadline by a week. The only thing I’m asking you is, will your essay be better if you hand it in a week from now?”We both knew the answer was “no.” I worked my ass off to finish it on time.Only delay things when you’ll do a better job with that extra time. Do it now, or do it better later.Being a good listener can steer you in the right direction, but in the long term, it also helps you maintain close, valuable relationships.Everyone can give a hug, but not everybody calls just to ask, “How are you?” Put in the time. Ask, listen, care, repeat.We all have moments where we’re tempted to cancel plans. Sometimes, the effort of leaving the house can feel Herculean, even for something “fun.”But new and novel experiences are what makes life beautiful. When you give in to laziness, you’re not fully participating in your own life — which also isn’t fair to your friends, family, partner, and the other people who want to share it with you.It used to be that if your dad was a farmer — and you were a man — you became a farmer. Women didn’t get to choose what they wanted to be. And the ability to learn things beyond your immediate world was limited, if not impossible.Today, access to information is easier than it’s ever been. Obviously, there are still structural barriers that limit what people can do, but those who take advantage of this access to information — who read books, who ask questions, who follow their curiosity — have more power to envision, and shape, their futures. It’s hard to dream about what you don’t know.Just be a nice person. If you have difficulty defining what a “nice person” is, you’re likely a jerk.“The most certain way to succeed,” Thomas Edison once said, “is always to try just one more time.” Success, however you define it, never came from not trying. And often, it comes after first failing time and time again.Written by"
6,Amazon Accidentally Sent Out Their Email Template,"It’s comforting to see that even the titans of industry occasionally blunder.Last week, a Reddit user posted an email template that had been mistakenly sent out by Amazon. Although the full story behind the error is not known, it appears that a member of Amazon’s marketing team accidentally sent out the template before completing it.The Reddit post immediately took off, receiving 76,500 upvotes. If you have not yet seen the template, it looks like this:Although it is easy to chuckle at Amazon’s gaffe, it is important to recognize the intrinsic value of the leaked template. In fact, every marketing team could benefit from following the template’s simple instructions.Let’s break it down.A reader’s focus will initially gravitate to the photo at the top of the email. The image should be noticeable and attention-grabbing with bright and attractive colors. But, as you’ll notice in the template above, the image should not overwhelm the reader.A 600 x 200 image is the perfect size for attracting without overwhelming. Placing the image at the top of the email allows the reader’s focus to dwell there before moving to the headline.The headline cannot be too long, but it must summarize the entire purpose of the email. This is the most valuable space in the entire email. The quality of the headline will determine whether the reader continues to read the rest of the content or stops reading entirely.A good headline is hard to create. As the template states, the headline must summarize why this email is important. Why should your reader keep reading? What is in it for them? What do they stand to gain?These are all questions that must be answered when creating a successful headline.It’s important to note that the contents of the email template are not Amazon’s own creation. The words come from the writer Gary Provost, the author of the book “Make Every Word Count.” Provost understood that combining short and long sentences created a melody of words that would attract readers.Here are the same three paragraphs as above, this time highlighted in colors. The colors represent the length of the sentences — red being five words, yellow being two words or less, pink representing four words or less, green representing medium-length sentences, and blue representing long sentences. Look at how the colors of each paragraph change the rhythm and flow of the words:The marketing call to action, or CTA , should provoke an immediate response from your audience. Your audience should feel that they must click on whatever you are selling them or telling them. They must be intrigued, and they must be convinced that they will miss out on something worthwhile if they fail to follow the CTA.It sounds simple, but it’s shocking how many companies forget this advice. Time and time again, I see emails or marketing campaigns that just say “click here,” but that will never work.I have never clicked on a button at the bottom of a marketing email that says “click here,” and I imagine you have not either. The CTA needs to invoke an urge to act. The reader should see the words and feel that they must click on the link or be left out entirely.On their online blog, the marketing powerhouse HubSpot collected a list of powerful CTAs used by companies. Some examples: the agency EPIC uses “Let’s start a new project together,” and Humboldt County’s site invites readers to “Follow the Magic.” Others, like Netflix, follow a simple route by telling viewers to “Join free for a month.”The point here is simple: Think outside the box. What do your readers want to see? What are they interested in? If your CTA is not compelling, perhaps it’s time to brainstorm something new.Written by"
7,When Women ‘Dangle the Steak' in Front of Men,"I truly thought that by now, there wasn’t an online comment that could really hit me so hard it hurt.But oh man, I really did underestimate the ability of vile human beings using their words in the cruelest ways possible.A fellow writer explained, in a recent emotional article, how she was raped at a party, when she drifted off to sleep, by a guy she thought was decent.I replied with a comment, sending my heart out to her, because our stories were so incredibly similar. I was sexually assaulted by my boyfriend at the time, whom I was in love with.Enter the garbage human being. I’ll let his words explain the essence of who he is:Do this:For months, take a steak and put it in front of a big dog’s face, but right when the dog tries to grab it from your hand, pull it away.Do that at least three times a week for 3 months.Tell me how long it takes for that dog to continue pursuing that steak after you’ve pulled it away.Y’all know I’ve got some sh*t to say, so let’s get right to it.They have done absolutely nothing to validate that they deserved or asked for the deep violation enacted against them.They are not in charge of taking any semblance of responsibility for the depraved and selfish behaviour of others.Insinuating anything otherwise is absolutely incomprehensible and disgusting.I’m also going to explain the simple concept of what a healthy, functional romantic relationship looks like, coming from a woman who has both existed in an abusive relationship in the past and currently thrives in a fantastic and supportive marriage:When a partner truly respects you as a human being, they also respect your consent. They additionally appreciate that there is more to you than just a body, and said body does not exclusively exist for their sexual satisfaction.Based on your theory, I should have been sexually assaulted at least 3 times, by each of my partners.And yet, 2/3 of them did not try to rape me.In fact, I communicated the boundaries of my sexual activity, and the 2/3 in question replied:“Yeah, sure, of course. Whatever you’re comfortable with, I’ll respect that.”The man who sexually assaulted me was my boyfriend for over a year.My husband and I were together for almost 4 years before we got married and had intercourse for the first time.How does your little scenario explain that?I can’t believe I’m even taking the time to explain this sh*t right now, but f*ck, here we are.Men are not biologically-driven sexual animals — they are intentional human beings who make conscious decisions, just as every other person in the world.Women are not pieces of meat for the consumption of others.The consent of a human being is not synonymous to a tender, juicy steak.Dogs are simple creatures lacking in self-control (I have a rescue, I know this to be true). Your excuse of men being synonymous to an animal who cannot be held accountable for their actions is deplorable.Men are entirely in control of their actions and decisions. Whether or not they choose to exercise that self-control in ways that are morally right is a conscious decision — a decision which, when morality is ignored, rightfully comes along with consequences.Women who choose to exercise their basic human right to indicate their consent are not in charge of managing and accommodating for the sexual urges of grown a** adult men.F*ck right off.I even resent calling you “sir”.Frankly, I’d rather call you a “steaming pile of garbage”.Oh look, I just did it. Whoops.Just a question:Have you ever explained this little scenario comparison to the women in your life?What does your mom have to say about it? And your sister? Your female friends? How did they receive it?I imagine you haven’t mentioned it to them — because your comment is so entirely shameful that you truly could not confidently say this same sh*t to the women you love in your life.So what makes it in any way appropriate to say something so disgraceful to women online?Consider the women in your life for a moment… consider that 1/3 of those women who you truly love have been sexually assaulted.And your words directly shame these survivors.Give that a little thought for a quick second.There are plenty of things that I would like to type out to you, that I cannot publically put into words.But in a Twitter DM, with two other survivors, I can assure you that the depths of your depravity were discussed in detail, and we’ve got opinions about garbage people like yourself.You’ll never read this, because I blocked your sorry a** so fast after receiving this infuriating comment that I got whiplash.This is why safe communities for survivors and women are so damn important.Because people like you exist in the world — and we have a right to thrive in this space and tell our stories without your sickening abuse.Here’s hoping we never cross paths, ever again.Never miss a single beat — sign up for my monthly newsletter to get the scoop!👉 https://bit.ly/33XgtKTWritten by"
8,Why Do Men’s Legacies Matter More Than Women’s Safety?,"Almost immediately after Washington Post reporter Felicia Sonmez tweeted out a link to an article about the 2003 rape accusation against Kobe Bryant, who died on Sunday alongside his 13-year-old daughter and seven others, the harassment began. Sonmez was harangued and threatened, her address posted publicly. In fear for her safety, she checked into a hotel.On Monday, the Washington Post put Sonmez on administrative leave, noting in a statement that the paper was reviewing whether her tweets violated their social media policy, and saying that she “displayed poor judgment that undermined the work of her colleagues.”Her tweet, which was presented without comment, linked to a Daily Beast article from 2016 headlined, “Kobe Bryant’s Disturbing Rape Case.” She also tweeted about the thousands of people who responded with abuse and threats, and noted that it “speaks volumes about the pressure people come under to stay silent in these cases.”We can argue about when it’s appropriate to speak negatively about someone who has died tragically, and whether a person should be remembered by their worst moment. What is inarguable, however, is that a woman was punished — both personally and professionally — simply for drawing attention to a well-known allegation that reflected poorly on a beloved male celebrity.It’s an outrageous reminder that institutions will protect powerful men’s reputations above all else — even a woman’s safety.Washington Post media critic Eric Wemple writes that management asked Sonmez to take her tweets down, but that she was delayed because of the barrage of threats. Once the tweets were deleted and Sonmez had checked into a hotel, she found out she was being placed on leave; managing editor Tracy Grant told her in an email that her “behavior on social media is making it harder for others to do their work as Washington Post journalists.”How a tweet pointing to an accurate news story would make life difficult for other reporters is unclear. What is obvious is that Sonmez was reprimanded for tweeting something important.The Daily Beast article Sonmez linked to wasn’t salacious; it was a straightforward recounting of what happened in 2003: Bryant was accused of raping and choking a 19-year-old woman in Colorado. He was arrested and charged with felony assault, and the woman later requested the case be dropped because of the harassment and character assassination she faced. (In addition to threats from Bryant’s fans, the athlete’s defense team made a number of smears against the accuser, including that the vaginal trauma she suffered could have been from having multiple sexual partners over the course of several days.)What is not often talked about, but is extremely important, is that Bryant issued an apology where he made clear he believed the woman when she said she did not feel their encounter was consensual: “Although I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual, I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did. After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.”A woman was punished — both personally and professionally — simply for drawing attention to a well-known allegation that reflected poorly on a beloved male celebrity.Bryant also noted that the woman was not paid any money and that he did not doubt her motives for bringing the accusation forward.The truth is that it was a remarkable apology, one that recognized at least some of the harm caused. In fact, in a 2016 interview, Neil Irvin, the director of the nonprofit Men Can Stop Rape, said Bryant’s apology stood in stark contrast to other high-profile men’s responses to allegations of harassment or assault.“Kobe is the only accused individual who I’ve ever seen provide an apology in writing in my 16 years of doing rape prevention work,” Irvin said. “I read it and it fits with what I know about rape: survivors don’t lie… The question I’m left with is how do you honor Kobe’s statement and what appears to be his subsequent growth, without ignoring there was a survivor who also has to overcome the violence that Kobe admits to.”If Bryant’s fans are looking for a way to reconcile their love and grief with the accusation, one way would be to consider this apology as a sign of someone who seemed to be taking stock of the hurt he caused.All of which is to say: This is complicated. How to navigate reporting on a well-known person’s death and legacy — honoring the good they did while being honest about the bad — is not easy. Especially when you’re talking about issues of gender, sexuality, race, class, and celebrity.Yet, instead of using this moment as an opportunity to take on the nuance of the issue, the Post bent to power over truth and placed Sonmez on leave. It seems the paper’s higher-ups decided, in the midst of a safety crisis for one of their reporters, that public relations were more important than Sonmez herself.That’s not just wrong — it’s also misguided. Why would rape victims trust the Washington Post with their stories if they think the paper is more concerned with appeasing an online mob than holding powerful men to account?So let’s not mince words about what happened: A powerful publication silenced a female reporter for tweeting about rape. No matter how you feel about Bryant, speaking ill of the dead, or reporters on Twitter — that doesn’t serve anyone’s legacy.Written by"
9,Is A.I. the Antichrist?,"It may seem that old religious principles would have little to say about new technology, but in the Islamic community, the intersection of technology and religion is a common topic of discussion. Biotech, environmental conservation, smartphone use, and artificial intelligence are all relevant concerns to practicing Muslims. For example, as religious scholar Abdal Hakim Murad recently asked in a lecture: How would a person genetically engineered to have gills navigate the rulings around fasting in the month of Ramadan, where even drinking water is not allowed in daylight hours?Recently, I was forwarded text messages on WhatsApp introducing an intriguing idea: What if A.I. was the Antichrist? I’m a Muslim, but I’m not a conspiracy theorist, so I questioned the logic. I went down the rabbit hole, watching videos explaining the connection. The idea is part of a wider conversation about the concern that technology might be gaining importance over religion among Muslims.In each generation, there are people who believe we’re living in the end of times — or pretty close to it. Companions of the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم), the founder of Islam, thought that the end of the world would happen in their lifetimes, 1,400 years ago. People in every generation after that, Muslim or not, also thought they’d be the last on earth.But in Islamic belief, the Antichrist — known to Muslims as Dajjaal — will appear before the world ends. The prophecy says he will bring tyranny and misguidance to the world, use trickery to proclaim himself a prophet, and ultimately be defeated by the Prophet Eesa — the Muslim name for Christ.It is believed that some of Dajjaal’s identifying characteristics were passed down from the Prophet Muhammad so we can recognize him when he comes. One translation of these descriptions reads: “He will be a young man” who is “blind or defective” in his right eye. This eye will be “neither prominent nor sunken, and will look like a floating grape.” He will also be “sterile, with no children born to him,” and will deceive people, using special abilities, to bring rain.As a society, are we walking a dangerous line toward worshipping A.I.?Various people in history were rumored to be Dajjaal, including Adolf Hitler and Michael Jackson (who, at the height of his fame, had what some thought was a Dajjaal-like influence over his fans and used related symbolism in his music videos). Now there is a branch of Muslims who believe that A.I. could be Dajjaal, or at least a part of him. In these discussions, A.I. refers to not only artificial intelligence but also all the technologies that use it.Islamic scholars in eschatology, the branch of theology relating to the end of the world, use examples of current technology to link A.I. to Dajjaal. One example is Sheikh Imran Hosein, who has used scripture to theorize that Dajjaal will have a human form but will lack a soul and a self. He could be a robot — human-looking but soulless. The “eye like a floating grape” could be a computer or camera lens. Cloud seeding by A.I. could be the means through which he brings rain.It’s important to consider these abstract ideas because it’s healthy to question our relationship to technology. The broader concern at the root of these conversations is that Dajjaal’s control over the human race might have already begun with our growing addiction to technology. First comes fascination, then worship. My iPhone obsession has led me to ponder whether I am fulfilling my religious duty to worship God and no one else. As a society, are we walking a dangerous line toward worshipping A.I.?In scholarly settings, as well as on local radio stations, in mosques, or in informal gatherings, Muslims often discuss how prophecies from 1,400 years ago apply today, and whether the words of the Prophet Muhammad are to be taken literally in certain contexts, as in the case of Dajjaal and technology. The sayings of the Prophet Muhammad are often broad enough to allow for this type of interpretation, so these ideas are not seen as particularly controversial, especially because most Muslims already accept the basic notion that Dajjaal will exist in some form.The most serious of these discussions live in scholarly circles, special lectures on the end of time, and conspiracy theory message boards. For most people, however, they occur in occasional conversations with friends and are perhaps not taken as earnestly as discussions relating to practical rulings on contemporary daily life, since there’s no telling when these prophesied events may occur.Islamic teachings may be unresolved on the topic of A.I. and Dajjaal, but in other aspects of the intersection of life and technology, they are quite clear. For example, even though Muslims believe that the world will someday end on God’s command, we still have no right to destroy the planet: Conservation and the imperative not to waste are encoded into Islamic practice.Other aspects require more thought and perhaps new religious rulings, like questions around biotech. Are genetically modified foods halal — permissible for Muslims to consume? What can we do with our bodies and organs, according to Islamic law, and what are the limits? Medical intervention is accepted and even encouraged in Islam, but trying to improve on human creation by genetic engineering is more complicated. Whether it’s permissible to use your smartphone as a Quran, however, remains up for debate.Nevertheless, though it often seems that there is a disconnect between science and religion, the two are surprisingly complementary.Most ethical debates around technology are framed in a humanist, atheist, or at least agnostic way. But it is useful to consider how beliefs around technology may be shaped by something deeper than consumerism and secular values. There are approximately 1 billion Muslims in the world, and apart from Muslims, billions more people of other faiths who also must consider these issues in relation to their beliefs. A significant portion of the world may hold widely different views on tech than the usual Silicon Valley crew. Exploring their ideas may bring to light new ways of looking at our relationship to technology and allow for a wider, more all-encompassing conversation — regardless of whether you believe we should be watching technology for signs of Dajjaal.Written by"
10,Does Your College Use Facial Recognition Tech? Find Out Here.,"College applicants and students can now check whether nearly 90 universities in the United States may use facial recognition on their campuses.Technology activism organization Fight For The Future, as well as Students for Sensible Drug Policy, surveyed colleges asking if they would ever consider installing the technology. Representatives from 45 schools, including Carnegie Mellon University, Barnard College and MIT, said their colleges were not using the technology and wouldn’t in the future. The other schools did not respond or comment.Privacy advocates have warned that facial recognition in public places removes the element of anonymity, meaning people can be actively tracked wherever they go.“[W]ould you support a new law that said whenever you go into public … you need to wear a digital barcode around your neck?” said Ben Ewen-Campen, a councilor for Somerville, Massachusetts who proposed the city’s now-enacted facial recognition ban.You can check which schools fall into each category at banfacialrecognition.com.Written by"
11,Microsoft Introduces Project Petridish to Find the Best Neural Network for your Problem,"Neural architecture search(NAS) is one of the hottest trends in modern deep learning technologies. Conceptually, NAS methods focus on finding a suitable neural network architecture for a given problem and dataset. Think about it as making machine learning architecture a machine learning problem by itself. In recent years, there have been an explosion in the number of NAS techniques that are making inroads into mainstream deep learning frameworks and platforms. However, the first generation of NAS models have encountered plenty of challenges adapting neural networks that were tested on one domain to another domain. As a result, the search for new NAS techniques is likely to continue driving new innovations in the space. Recently, Microsoft Research unveiled Petridish, a NAS algorithm to optimize the selection of neural network architectures.NAS exists because the process of designing neural networks is incredibly resource consuming. In the current deep learning ecosystem, relying on well-known, top-performing networks provides few guarantees in a space where your dataset can look very different from anything those proven networks have encountered before. In many cases, NAS methods often takes hundreds of GPU-days to find good architectures, and can be barely better than random search. There is another problem in machine learning that resembles the challenges of NAS techniques: feature selection.Just like NAS methods, feature selection algorithms need to extract relevant features for a model given a specific dataset. Obviously, selecting a feature is drastically simpler than a neural network architecture but many of the principle of feature selection techniques served as inspiration to the Petridish team.Given the recent popularity of NAS methods, many might think that NAS is a recent discipline. It is unquestionable that NAS has experienced a renaissance since 2016 with the publication of Google’s famous paper on NAS with reinforcement learning. However, many of its origin trace back to the late 1980s. One of the earlies NAS papers was the 1988 “Self Organizing Neural Networks for the Identification Problem”. From there, the space saw a handful of publication outlining interesting techniques but it wasn’t until the Google push that NAS got the attention of the mainstream machine learning community. If you are interested in the publication history of NAS methods, the AutoML Freiburg-Hannover website provides one of the most complete compilations up to this day.When exploring the NAS space, there are two fundamental types of techniques: backward-search and forward-search. Backward-search methods have been the most common approach for implementing NAS methods. Conceptually, backward-search NAS methods, starts with a super-graph that is the union of all possible architectures, and learns to down-weight the unnecessary edges gradually via gradient descent or reinforcement learning. While such approaches drastically cut down the search time of NAS they have a major limitation in the case that they require human domain knowledge is needed to create a supergraph in the first place.Forward-search NAS methods try to grow neural network architectures from small to large. This approach resembles many of the principles of feature selection algorithms in deep learning models. Unlike backward approaches, forward methods do not need to specify a finite search space up front making them more general and easier to use when warm-starting from prior available models and for lifelong learning.Petridish is a forward-search NAS method inspired by feature selection and gradient boosting techniques. The algorithm works by creating a gallery of models to choose from as its search output and then incorporating stop-forward and stop-gradient layers to more efficiently identify beneficial candidates for building that gallery, and uses asynchronous training.The Petridish algorithm can be broken down in three fundamental phases:The incorporation of the Pareto frontier is an interesting addition to Petridish that allow researchers to more easily determine the architecture that achieves the best combination of properties they’re considering for a particular task. The estimate of the Pareto frontier makes it easier to see the tradeoff between accuracy, FLOPS, memory, latency, and other criteria. In the following figure, the models along the Pareto frontier (red line) make up the search output, a gallery of models from which researchers and engineers can choose.Microsoft Research evaluated Petridish across different NAS benchmarks. Specifically, Petridish was tested on image classification models using the CIFAR-10 dataset and then transferring the results to ImageNet. On CIFAR-10, Petridish achieves 2.75 ±0.21 percent average test error, with 2.51 percent as the best result, using only 3.2M parameters and five GPU days of search time on the popular cell search space. On transferring the models found on CIFAR-10 to ImageNet, Petridish achieves 28.7 ±0.15 percent top-1 test error, with 28.5 percent as the best result, using only 4.3M parameters on the macro search space. The initial tests were able to outperform state of the art NAS methods while maintaining viable levels of computing cost.Petridish is an interesting addition to the fast growing ecosystem of NAS techniques. The fact that Petridis relies on forward-searching models makes it even more intriguing as most popular NAS methods relied on backward-search techniques. Microsoft already includes NAS models as part of its Azure ML platform so it would be interesting is Petridish becomes part of that stack.Written by"
12,Isaias Hernandez Is Making Space for Queer People of Color in the Environmental Movement,"Climate change is harmful to all humans, but intersections of class, race, and gender alike can make certain groups more vulnerable. From the ways that redlining puts communities of color at higher risk during heatwaves to the negative global impact on indigenous populations, it’s clear that institutional privilege extends protections even when it comes to the environment. But in the fight for environmental justice, these voices often suffer for lack of mainstream representation.Isaias Hernandez runs Queer Brown Vegan, an Instagram page that provides educational breakdowns of environmental terms with an emphasis on intersectional perspectives. A graduate of UC Berkeley’s environmental science program, Hernandez has studied climate change and worked within student organizations to diversify the field. Hernandez spoke with Tenderly about his experiences as a POC in environmental spaces, how he came to co-found Alluvia Mag, and how he veganizes his childhood favorite Mexican dishes.Isaias Hernandez: I’m Mexican American, and my parents are originally from Mexico. I’m originally from Los Angeles, CA. Mainly the San Fernando Valley, if you’re familiar with the area.A lot of the dishes that my parents would make when I was growing up were Mexican dishes. A lot of the times, the standard set of foods in a Mexican household is rice, beans, and tortillas. For me, I remember Saturday breakfasts were always chorizo and potatoes. And that’s obviously something that’s changed now, we do soyrizo and potatoes, or use JUST Egg. One of the most memorable dishes for me is called pambazo — it’s essentially torta bread that’s dipped in salsa. The filling can have meat, but my mom would always put mashed potatoes in it. And then you can sprinkle it with onion, lettuce, cheese, or cream. And it’s easy to do a vegan version of that.My older sister was vegan back in high school, and I was in middle school at that time. She would always talk about animal cruelty — she was very woke in the sense that she would tell me all about these injustices that happened in the system. I was open to hearing it out, and I accepted it. And then in college, I started developing illnesses. Near the end of my senior year of college, I wasn’t able to digest a lot of animal based products. At that point I’d already cut out red meat, and was only eating chicken. And eventually I got pretty sick, and my doctor told me to write a food diary. Essentially, I figured out that I was very allergic to animal based products. My doctor advised me to cut them out of my diet.When I was at school, I was also involved in various organizations. Some of them talked about animal cruelty, but another aspect that really resonated me was advocating for farm workers’ rights. I felt that going vegan, for me, was a step towards not only bettering my physical and mental health, but for contributing toward the greater good and society as a whole.Yeah, there’s an event called the Vegan Street Fair held in the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles, it’s been around for a few years now. It’s essentially a community of vegans, mainly made up of people of color. And I sought out this community, and talked to a lot of people, and it gave me a more comfortable zone to be in and understand that there are other vegans out there who look like me. People of color, especially Mexican people. And they were able to really introduce me to a lot of concepts and ideas that really reconnected me to my own ancestral roots — that plant-based dishes have been part of our lifestyle, and that the Mexican foods I eat can be made vegan. And it’s much healthier, and still so delicious. There are so many plant-based meat alternatives that you can use in Mexican dishes. It was a big change, but it wasn’t as hard as I thought it would be, once I was educated properly.One of the main reasons that I originally wanted to pursue environmentalism is that I felt that one, whenever I would go to nature events growing up, nobody there really looked like me. Even in college, that was still the case — and additionally, I also noticed there weren’t many people who shared a queer identity. So I felt that I have these two different backgrounds. One, being a person of color in the environmental field, where it’s largely dominated by white people. And two, how I can navigate my queerness in these settings, when a lot of the first people impacted by environmental injustices are low-income, queer trans people of color. And I’ve known that these communities have been organizing since the beginning to demand justice, and they’re not really given the recognition or platform to talk about their experiences. Mainstream environmentalism views it as not as important or popular to address. And of course there’s great work being done for the environment, but also this work often fails to recognize how race, environment, class, status, and gender intersect. So I want to use my platform to communicate with a wide audience, and especially as a way to connect with other queer people of color. Because I didn’t really have anyone to look up to as I was entering these spaces, and it can be hard to navigate.I co-created the magazine with one of my best friends. What really inspired us — well, we actually Googled “environmental people of color magazines” and nothing really showed up. So we thought, wouldn’t it be really great to highlight black, indigineous people of color doing dope work related to the environment, through an artistic or creative lens? So during the year when I lived in Oakland postgrad, and while she was still a senior in college, we worked to connect with people in the Bay Area, and out of state too. And essentially what bloomed out of that was a project highlighting narratives of climate storytelling that came from perspectives of environmentalists who are people of color. Alluvia is a platform for people seeking diversity in the environmental movement.Currently, we’re doing outreach to any writers that may be interested in an op-ed piece for our second issue, and any environmental creatives to contribute to the issue as well. We’re trying to reach outside of California, and really highlight different areas and different communities. Especially because California is generally a pretty environmentally friendly state, we want to really make sure that voices from other places are getting out there too.There’s this page called Slow Factory, and it’s an environmental education page that really highlights a lot of topics within sustainability and environmentalism. They really dig deep and deconstruct what words really mean, and provide a clear context of race and class to those terms. So they’re great at providing a deeper understanding of what sustainability really is.Another page that I love is run by one of my good friends actually — it’s called Go Green Save Green. She’s a woman of color, and she highlights a lot of environmental topics and news articles. The page really helps people stay informed about what’s happening currently in the environmental sphere.And lastly, another friend of mine runs a page called Brown Girl Green. She’s half Jewish and half Filipina, a brown environmentalist. She talks about what it’s like to be a woman of color in the environmental field, and covers a variety of topics.You really want to ask yourself, what are the things that I can instantly eliminate from my diet? I didn’t cut out all animal products at once, I stopped consuming things one by one. My first step was to stop eating red meat, and fish, since I hardly ate that to begin with. I’d say you should start including vegan substitutes while you’re still eating meat, or while you’re vegetarian. I think a lot of the time, we don’t really give ourselves the opportunity to try all the options that are out there. And now, in 2020, veganism has really exploded, and there are so many incredible options out there.And it’s not all about being perfect — I know that mistakes are to be made. The most important part is that you’re thinking about the impact of what you’re doing, and what it means to you on a personal level, but also in terms of your environmental impact.A quick thing I love to make — because you know, as millennials, we’re always on the go — is spaghetti. Trader Joe’s has these amazing vegan meatballs, they’re so good. It’s really affordable to get pasta, marinara sauce, zucchini, and mushrooms. It’s really quick to make — and it only costs around $8 for several portions.A complaint that I think we all hear a lot is that veganism is expensive, but it really doesn’t have to be. And yes, buying processed products is expensive, but if you incorporate produce and shop resourcefully, it doesn’t have to cost any more!Written by"
13,Stop Calling Animals ‘It’,"At its core, veganism is simply a philosophy that rejects the exploitation of animals. However, the vegan movement is full of different ideas, expanding and broadening as time passes. Intersectionality, a term coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw in 1989, is, in her words, “…a lens through which you can see where power comes and collides, where it interlocks and intersects. It’s not simply that there’s a race problem here, a gender problem here, and a class or LBGTQ problem there. Many times that framework erases what happens to people who are subject to all of these things.” Intersectionality is what inspires some animal rights activists to fight for the rights of oppressed slaughterhouse workers or for expanding access to fresh produce for those living in food deserts, and allows us to make links between structural racism and misogyny and the violence perpetrated against animals.Language is one of the next big frontiers for the vegan philosophy, and we as activists have an opportunity to influence others to change something that may seem innocuous to the average person: Referring to other animals as if they’re objects.There’s no arguing that the way we choose to express ourselves can impact our own perception and those of our audience: so why not use language to bring us closer to animals?Recently, a stranger asked me about my dog, Daryl, whom I adopted from a local shelter. “What kind of dog is it? It looks like a German Shepherd.” The question took me aback. “HE is probably a German Shepherd mix, but I’m not sure,” I abruptly replied. This stranger didn’t mean any harm, and her words certainly didn’t bother Daryl. But it reignited my passion for a philosophy that I adopted a long time ago: not calling other animals “it.”By now, we all know that the way we use language can shape our ideas and culture. Parenting experts release novel-length guides to using language to bring up children, how certain words and phrases impact their perception of the world and reward systems. Linguists and psychologists have developed programs for trauma survivors that center almost exclusively on using language to move past their experiences and live normal lives. And perhaps most insidiously, big marketing companies spend time and money researching exactly which words and phrases impact our buying decisions. There’s no arguing that the way we choose to express ourselves can impact our own perception and those of our audience: so why not use language to bring us closer to animals?When my son Sam was two, like many kids, he was afraid of insects. Seeing one, he’d either scream and run away or hide behind my leg until I reminded him he was safe. Being vegan though, we didn’t kill the spiders who lived in each bathroom and the ceiling corners of our kitchen. Sometimes this made Sam a little terrified of potty training. I didn’t want to relocate our peaceful roommates, so I devised a plan to name all our spiders, with the hope that it would endear my son to our scary house-guests.One by one, we named every spider and wrote it in large lettering on a note card, which we placed next to each reachable one until we got to the biggest, scariest Wolf spider who lived in our downstairs bathroom, the most-used bathroom in the house. He was big for a house spider and lived right behind the toilet, which, to a frightened two-year-old was prime toe-biting territory. We decided on a name and since this was the bathroom most frequented by guests, his card read “This is Daniel. He lives here and we love him, please don’t touch, smoosh or move him. Thank you.” We would greet him daily, have lengthy one-way conversations, tell jokes, and each time we’d potty train in Daniel’s bathroom, I would sing “Daniel my Spider” to the tune of Elton John’s “Daniel.” Later, I’d discover he was most likely female, and since Wolf spiders only live about a year or so, Daniel was no one’s brother and was not older than me.The simple act of giving a name and story to another animal taught my son to respect and love someone who didn’t look like him or share the same behaviors.I can’t recall how long it took, or when we phased out the note cards and songs, but since my experiment, Sam, who is now 9, has no fear of bugs — except, of course, for the occasional “surprise bathroom roach,” but I’d argue that anyone would be a little disturbed to find an unexpected person in the bathroom. The simple act of giving a name and story to another animal taught my son to respect and love someone who didn’t look like him or share the same behaviors.According to Writer’s Digest, we should only be referring to other animals as “he” or “she” when we have a personal attachment to them, like Daniel and Daryl. It’s also acceptable when reading a book where animals who can speak are the main characters. In all other cases, one is expected to use “it.” I believe this standard is outdated and offensive.I believe the closest we can come to defining the vegan perspective is that we extend personhood to other animals, which leaves no room for referring to them in the same way that we do objects.In veganism, the reason we abstain from objectifying animals and consuming their byproducts is because we recognize behaviors and traits that resemble or completely mirror our own: family, connection, and the wish to be free and alive. Though the definition of the word “person” refers only to humans, I believe the closest we can come to defining the vegan perspective is that we extend personhood to other animals, which leaves no room for referring to them in the same way that we do objects.If not “it,” then what? For over 600 years, those using the English language have used the word “they” to refer to unspecified individuals and those who don’t identify exclusively as masculine or feminine. It’s been an essential tool for genderqueer, trans, and non-binary individuals to reclaim their identities, and as a society, embracing “they” helps us tear down gendered expectations of each other. And while it’s far more important to focus our new language expectations on how we refer to fellow human beings, whose emotional and mental well-being rely on those they know and love reifying their identity, I would argue that… while we’re at it, why not include other animals on our journey to include the rejection of objectification as well?Changing our language can be difficult, but that doesn’t make it any less essential to veganism. Some of my biggest heroes in the vegan movement still use “it” to refer to other animals. I think this is partly because it’s hard: we begin learning communication and language from the moment we’re born and eliminating words and phrases can seem daunting. Also, because other animals don’t have a known opinion on the subject, they aren’t advocating one way or the other. But just as how choosing references for other humans has a positive cultural impact on oppressed individuals, so can choosing the way we reference other animals.For someone like me, who has dedicated years to the practice of eliminating the “it” word from how I refer to other animals, hearing it is like nails on a chalkboard. This is the same feeling as when I see someone chewing the meat off a bone or tossing chickens into a crate. At its core, referring to a cow, chicken or pig as “it” is an act of speciesism, which is exactly what we seek to eradicate as vegans. If we want to change the world for animals and create more compassionate consumers, we must take responsibility for the way we look at and refer to other animals.Perhaps this language change could open doors for non-vegans to begin associating other animals in the same way that vegans do, as individuals with feeling and interests, not as objects. Much like veganism, the practice of choosing better words for other animals will get easier as time goes on. When referring to the next animal you meet, use “they” until you’re told otherwise by their human companion. Believe me, no one will be asking you to refer to Fluffy as “it.”Written by"
14,You’re Running All Wrong,"Optimize Your Run, Defy Death and Attain Superpowers“You’re doing it all wrong.”A tall, willowy man with an aquiline nose, fair skin and long dark waves of flowing hair sat across from me. He was a voice teacher. A revered expert, in fact.According to him.“I’ll have another,” he said, raising his nearly empty bottle of Stella and nodding to me.“…and I’ll tell you how to make it right. So you don’t ruin your voice.”This was important to me — being a singer.I was also a bartender, by the way. A common and respectable combination. And it was slow that night. I looked forward to times like these though the money was not great. (Fewer customers = fewer tips) The conversation with patrons was often more meaningful, introspective, even philosophical.“There’s a reason you have a nose,” the Aquilined One began.“When you breathe, it filters and warms the air before it’s drawn into the lungs. If you breathe through your mouth, you’ll rip up your throat. You need to breathe only through your nose.”I know what you’re thinking. Maybe you’re not a singer. Maybe you’re not even a talker. Maybe you don’t care what happens to your voice.How would you like to increase your lung capacity? Or feel relaxed during your run instead of stressed out. Or look forward to your runs as your time to be inspired.I took Aquiline Guy’s stern advice and commenced breathing only through my nose when running. It was not easy.For the first two weeks, I was out of breath, tired and even a bit head-achy, sucking in the cold Chicago air forcefully through my nose, into my head. I had to slow down a lot, which was not encouraging. But I stuck with it.Slowly something beautiful happened. I adjusted.Besides feeling more badass in general for having the discipline to do this, there were unforeseen benefits.I found the fabled Runner’s High. I was an endorphin junkie. The feeling was euphoric.One night, singing a jazz standard with my band, just for fun, I tried to hold a note 4 measures longer than usual. The crazy thing was: I was able to hold it twice as long as that, almost effortlessly. It was shocking. My lung capacity had dramatically expanded.I started to feel so relaxed during my runs that I almost felt I could — if I wanted — seamlessly and instantly fall asleep. It was weird.I started to look forward to my runs as my time to be inspired, unravel problems, come up with new ideas. I found myself using my runs to write most of the lyrics for new songs.Recently, I learned through an article on yogic practices, the probable reason for this extreme feeling of relaxation and why running had become my favorite time for problem-solving and lyric-writing. According to Dr. John Douillard DC, CAP, nasal breathing during exercise increases alpha brain wave activity.The “alpha state” is that not-quite-asleep zone we find ourselves in just before dosing off. It’s the mental state sustained in meditation as well as the state of being in “the flow” artists and athletes rhapsodize over.Years later, I learned nasal breathing stimulates the sinuses to release nitric oxide which has lots of amazing benefits that don’t happen during mouth-breathing.Nitric oxide:Nose breathing was just part of my education in running, though.Since I loved running so much, I overdid it. I ran 5 miles every day without fail. On concrete.This caused a terrible condition known as shin-splints. It’s an inflammation of the muscle tissue attached to the shinbone.Ever been kicked in the shins? It’s like that except the pain goes on. I used to just blow it off and “power through,” running the next day and the next until it was unbearable.I wrapped my shins tightly with ace bandages to help ease the pain. And I kept running. I didn’t see how crazy this was until my chiropractor asked about my strange habit.Chiropractor: Why are you wrapping your legs like that?Me: Oh, no big deal. It’s just shin splints from running.Chiropractor: You have to stop that.Me: Running? I can’t.Chiropractor: Yes you can. Your’re impacting your legs with such force that it’s pulling the muscle away from the bone.Me: Ew…Chiropractor: Yeah, so don’t wrap your legs anymore and stop running ’til your legs heal.Me, with desperation: Then what?Chiropractor: Then don’t run every single day. And run on a softer surface. And on your toes.Well. That was a lot of new information to take in. I was ON it.Like most city runners I had been running on the sidewalk much to the chagrin of people walking their dogs and anyone with a child in a stroller. This would have to stop.I didn’t have access to a track at the time so I chose the asphalt of the streets as this actually is a much softer surface.It was also dangerous. I wasn’t sharing the space with erratic chasing dogs on strained leashes, hilariously bouncing babies in strollers and their annoyed swerving parents. I was sharing it with busses, motorcycles, scooters and yes, cars.So I strategized to keep myself safe. I could run defensively if I ran the opposite way traffic was going. This seemed to freak out a few drivers, but at least I could see in the distance — with some notice — when a 2-tonne machine with wheels was careening my way. Maybe some fancy footwork, but no surprises.And about that footwork, running on my toes…this was not the easiest thing to get used to. I felt almost embarrassed by it. Would people stare at me and laugh?“Mommy, why is that funny lady ballet dancing in the street?”Let them talk.I got used to it and found it decreased the impact on my shins as well as my knees, which had also started to ache.I tapered down my running routine to 4 days a week, then 3. After overdoing it one day, my knees were so sore and swollen that I had to take 6 months off running. Since my dad had his knees replaced and it did not seem like much fun, I took this injury seriously.Today I run a few miles a few days a week. Sometimes I run at the gym on an actual running track and sometimes in the streets with all the fun excitement that comes with that experience.I do find running uphill exhilarating. One more thing to remember though: hills are meant for running UP, never DOWN. Running down a hill increases the impact on one’s muscles and joints to a much higher degree and increases the chances that you’ll trip and fall.The main thing to remember about running — for me, the closest feeling on earth to flying — is love & respect of the greatest piece of equipment I will ever have; my own magnificent body.Written by"
15,"If You Want to Live the Life of Your Dreams, You Must Be Fearless","Everyone has dreams, fewer people have intentions, less have plans, and then there’s the very last few who actually leap.What happens between the inception of an idea and its execution is that people become dismayed by what they will lose, which is a lot. Security, status, the general sense that people know what you’re doing with your life and so through their eyes, you can maybe feel alright about yourself.I am sorry to have to be the one to tell you that if you want the life of your dreams, you’re going to have to do what everyone else is afraid to do.You are going to need to be fearless in the face of everything that could go wrong. You are going to need to be unafraid to rack up debt, to hire a staff, to admit what you don’t know, to let someone else support you, to take home almost no income for the first months or years of your venture, to break out of the standard work structure and flow, to invest heavily in yourself and your skill set sometimes to the tune of your life savings and almost always at the cost of your comfort zone.You must applaud the people who are doing what you want to be doing and instead of trying to belittle them, you have to learn from them.You are going to need to be fearless in the face of being disliked, because people will dislike you, and it will probably get worse the better your life gets. People are jealous, small, and vindictive and you know this because you have the capacity to be all of those things, too. But it doesn’t matter, because now you have to rise. Now you have to applaud the people who are doing what you want to be doing and instead of trying to belittle them, you have to learn from them.You are going to have to not just hope that rejection doesn’t happen too often, but plan for it. You are going to have to be okay with being mocked, with being misunderstood, with being disliked. You are going to have to be okay with looking bad. You are going to have to be okay with failing, often publicly.This is part of the process.This is the part most people won’t do, which is why nothing ever changes for them.You are going to have to be fearless in the face of insecurity — that big, bad, lifelong bully that chains most people to their past lives. You are going to have to totally annihilate your concept of “living well,” and reaching “comfort,” and being safe and making smart choices.You are going to have to be fearless in the face of letting go of the dreams you had for a person you no longer are. You are going to have to take a long, hard look at what you’ve built and ask yourself honestly if it still matches the person you intend to be. When we’re young, we design a life for the person we think we’ll become. When we arrive, we often hold too tightly to a blueprint made for someone else.The beginning of your new life, the part of your existence where things get really, really good, is often a letting go. A shedding, a release.If you’re courageous enough, this is the part where you’ll come alive.This is the part where you’ll realize that absolutely anything you risked was worth it because what you get in return for those infinitesimal seconds of discomfort is far greater than you could have dreamed.What you’ll trade for maybe being generally liked by a lot of people is being absolutely loved for having a life-changing, massive impact on the lives of a few (or, really, a lot more than you’d ever reach if you kept playing small).What you’ll trade for being brave enough to show up exactly as you are is so much more respect, admiration, and connection than you’d ever receive trying to be someone you aren’t.What you’ll trade for an idea of security is actual security, because your sense of safety is no longer within a role or job or position or idea, it’s within you.What you’ll trade for a lukewarm life is one that’s on fire, one in which you finally are doing what you came here to do.Will every day of your new life be ablaze with this kind of fiery passion? No. It will still be hard, you will still worry, you will still fear, it will still be boring sometimes. But anything you do has risk, anything you do will be scary sometimes, anything will be boring once in a while. The point isn’t that you’re able to escape all of that, the point is that you’re willing to endure it for a greater outcome.If you really want the life of your dreams, you’re going to have to be willing to do what other people won’t.You are going to have to be the version of you that you know you are deep down.You are going to have to be uncomfortable.You are going to have to be fucking fearless.You are going to find that there’s no other way to live.Written by"
16,Diving into Abstractive Text Summarization — Part 1,"Text summarization is nowadays one of the most studied research topics in natural language processing (NLP) and has its applications in almost all domains of the internet, for example, e-shops, search engines and news websites that use summaries to give readers an overview of what a particular article might talk about.Text Summarization is a task to generate a shorter and concise version of a text while preserving the meaning of the original text.[1]Text summarization algorithms can be classified into two main categories:Extractive text summarization algorithms are capable of extracting key sentences from a text without modifying any word [2][3]. Abstractive summarization, instead, involves a complex process understanding the language, the context and generating new sentences. This frees the model of the constraint of using pre-written text but involves using large-scale data during training.A lot of algorithms for both extractive and abstractive text summarization are based on Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN). Furthermore, using RNNs in an Encoder-Decoder manner leads us to the well known Sequence-To-Sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture [4], which is one of the most used and best-performing approaches in machine translation. Most of the current advancements have been performed on very short summaries and documents: a lot of algorithms tend to perform worse when a big document has to be summarized in more than a few words. The majority of state-of-the-art algorithms use pre-trained word embeddings, for a better understanding of the concepts expressed in a text.Nowadays the amount of textual data is massive, and this led researchers to develop algorithms capable of representing words mathematically, in order to solve complex problems. What are word embeddings? Wikipedia states that a word embeddingis the collective name for a set of language modeling and feature learning techniques in natural language processing (NLP) where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers. Conceptually it involves a mathematical embedding from a space with one dimension per word to a continuous vector space with a much lower dimension.Word embeddings are learned in order to make these vectors capture all the semantical, hierarchical and contextual pieces of information in a word. The process of choosing the best embeddings for a project is often a trial-and-error methodology. By the way, some of the most famous and effective techniques for learning word embeddings are Word2Vec [5] and GloVe [6].Let’s focus on GloVe: it is an unsupervised learning algorithm developed at Stanford University for generating word embeddings by factorizing a global word-word co-occurrence matrix from a corpus. Resulting embeddings show interesting linear substructures.Embeddings of words like Verizon and Vodafone are very close to each other, while man and woman are quite distant.For this project I’ve used Keras, an Open Source Deep Learning Library written in Python, running on top of Intel® Optimization for TensorFlow. In practice, you can download GloVe pre-trained vectors here and add them to your model in Keras using an Embedding Layer.Once we set up a dictionary which maps words to vectors, we can build the embedding weights matrix that’ll be set in the model.We can now create the Embedding layer in Keras using the following command:There are plenty of datasets for text summarization. The most famous (and large) is the GigaWord Dataset, which can be purchased here and consists of nearly 10 million documents and over 4 billion tokens. If you want to do some experiments on publicly available datasets first, there are also the BBC News Summary and the Amazon Fine Food Reviews datasets.We can easily build a vanilla Seq2Seq model for abstractive text summarization using Keras, in order to train the model and evaluate its performance. A bidirectional LSTM is used for the Encoder, while the Decoder is made of a single unidirectional LSTM. The model has been trained on a single node of an Intel® Xeon® platform.Making a machine measure how much a predicted summary is “good” may seem quite strange. Furthermore, applying the standard accuracy measure is not the right choice for summarization. In 2004 Lin published a paper about a new package with more than just one metric used for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation algorithms, called Rouge: Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation [7]. The most common metrics from ROUGE are:There are a few GitHub repositories with Python implementations of the ROUGE metrics that you can use in your own projects, like this and this.We’ve discovered what is text summarization, how words can be represented mathematically in a vector space, a Seq2Seq model used for abstractive summarization, some of the datasets available and a set of metrics used to evaluate summaries. In Part. II the training process either on a single node or on multiple nodes will be explained in detail and some results will be shown.This article is one of a series of posts done as part of an Intel AI Incubator project for which I am part of. The project makes use of Intel® Optimization for TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn. Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors were used to train the model.Written by"
17,You Aren’t Supposed to Love the Way You Look,"If you’re like most people, you probably dislike photos of yourself.It’s not because you look bad — it’s because the way a camera captures your image is not the same as how you see yourself in the mirror. It’s the difference between what you expect to see and what you actually see. The problem is unfamiliarity.The digital age has blown this out of proportion.Our fixation on appearance is unprecedented. Never before in human history have our lives and bodies been so exposed, documented, and shared. To make matters worse, a constant barrage of highly edited images infiltrate the internet, widening our expectation gap and leading us to invent hyper-idealized versions of who we imagine we’re supposed to be. Anything less is humiliating, a public failure.When you try to compose a “best self,” which is really just your most physically perfect self, you begin to forget something really important: You’re not supposed to love the way you look.Do you remember the first time you saw yourself in the mirror?If not, do you remember the first time you saw yourself in a photo, or in a home video? Most likely, your response was not to think your jawline looked sharp or your legs seemed proportionate. You probably expressed intrigue and interest, but overall emotional neutrality. That’s because, by nature, your body is a neutral entity.As you grew up, you eventually determined that attractive people gain clout. They are more desirable, and therefore seem to hold more power.First you couldn’t accept yourself, and now you can’t be totally in love with yourself.Maybe you never stop associating ideal physical characteristics and social status. You spend the entirety of your life feeling inadequate and inferior. You don’t stop to ask if you're viewing yourself accurately, or if you’re prioritizing your values. Instead, a negative spiral takes hold: Your body is not ideal, so you’re doomed to occupy the lower end of the social hierarchy for eternity. In response to overwhelming negativity, you — consciously or not — subscribe to the “love yourself” philosophy. It seems to have worked wonders for everyone else, so maybe it will for you.The problem, you imagine, is that you’re not in love with your physical form. But this line of thinking only perpetuates more unrealistic standards. First you couldn’t accept yourself, and now you can’t be totally in love with yourself.You don’t stop to recognize that you were not designed to think this way.Often, when you have issues with self-image, acceptability, or desirability, you project them onto your physicality: the one thing you think you can control. But “loving yourself,” despite what some people might want you to believe, is not a matter of looking in a mirror and feeling physically or sexually attracted to yourself. Real self-love is much deeper than that — it’s not a decision you can make or a switch you can flip. It goes to the core of who you are, and who you think you can be.When you address what really matters — your connections with others, the impact you have on the world around you, the quality of your friendships, how you care for yourself — your concern with surface-level issues fades. Sure, you may still want to look your best, but it’s not the all-consuming problem it used to be.Hate does not motivate us to love, it only holds us back from living.What you see in others depends on what you’re committed to seeing in yourself. If you dislike someone, everything they do irritates you and nothing seems like enough to redeem them. Your own self-image is the same way. When you hate yourself for deeper reasons, you spend your time fixated on surface-level things. Your obsession with parts of your body is code for deeper dissatisfactions with who you perceive yourself to be.Hate does not motivate us to love, it only holds us back from living. If and when you can commit to truly trying to find the best in yourself, and to loving the invisible parts of yourself from an authentic place, you become enough. And that’s because you’re actively working to see yourself that way. Not perfect, not ideal, but enough.Nobody is going to convince you to have self-esteem. Healthy self-esteem only develops when you realize that being your own enemy is not moving you even the slightest bit closer to having the life you want.You cannot hate yourself into the life you want. You cannot hate yourself into the body you want. You cannot hate yourself into the love you want.When you’re committed to taking care of yourself and playing the hand you were dealt, you generate true self-love because you’re building on a solid foundation. And then, everything changes.Written by"

19,Some Insulting Things A Lot of White People Do,"I compiled a list of some annoying, creepy, inconsiderate, insulting, and/or disrespectful things some White people do which stresses me and other Black people out. I understand many of these things on my list aren’t necessarily intentional, but the intent of the actions don’t matter. The perception does. Your intentions can injure.Practice doing no harm.Say Not All White People. I know. I know. We’re not blaming all White people when we say White people.. I’m not talking about all White people, just the White people who do the uncomfortable and embarrassing stuff on this list and those who continue to believe they aren’t racist. But since you must come here to defend White people, Please read this first before you continue Take a day or two to meditate on it, then come back to read this list.Hijacking movements. I’m not even going there. Yes, I am. The Civil Rights Movement protected Blacks, but was hijacked by White women who dragged in everything they cared about to ensure they protected it. Now, everything is centered on White women. Everything. Black Lives Matter was to address Black lives mattering. Ya’ll took that and created All Lives Matter because God forbid we try to bring attention to ourselves, diverting attention from White people. #MeToo was for Black girls being sexually abused. You took that from us and made it about White women. Can we have something, please?White people, please stop this and even if you don’t do it, it is your job to stop your collective group from doing this. Every song or cry doesn’t have to be White centered. You don’t need a movement. You should move over and give others the space to protest. Look, listen, act. Don’t co-opt or outright steal a movement and they pretend it’s yours. Pirates do that stuff.Locking the doors when Black people walk by your cars. You don’t have to say a word. The locks locking as we pass by your vehicles tell us exactly how you feel about us. I’m trying to go into the store and get my salad stuff for dinner. I’m not thinking about entering your car. Our minds aren’t on you, your car, or whatever you believe is valuable. Decenter yourselves please and stop being afraid of people already. Most Black people’s parents have taught them early on there’s a very high price to pay if a White person accuses you of something. We aren’t trying to ruin our lives.Clutching your purses when I walk by. No matter how broke I am or how empty my bank account is, I never, EVER think of robbing you. You don’t have to clutch anything when I pass.Not moving on the sidewalk. I know you see me right. They made normal sidewalks for two people to walk on, in two different directions, at the same time. Why do you all feel I need to move for you, especially women? If you’re walking with your little White friend, how about one of you kindly move to the back or front and not inconvenience the person walking in the correct direction? I notice you White ladies I’m talking about never move, and you never think of moving. You stay in your place expecting the Black person to move out of your way. I see you flexing your White girl card from 1760.Blocking aisles in stores. I know see me trying to get by, yet you stand in the aisles and read your packages or text on your phone exercising all your White privilege. It makes you look like a racist. At the very least your parents raised a spoiled brat who has grown up to become a very inconsiderate adult. Move over, please. You gotta share this world with us. I know your parents probably told you it was yours and you can do anything you want. Well, you can’t!Not moving when I say excuse me. Not sure what that’s about, but if excuse me isn’t enough to make you move, I don’t know what else to do. Guess you’re waiting on me to bump you as I pass by so you can call the cops and say I assaulted you. What in the hell? If you’d stop ignoring us, being irritated by us, or acting like we don’t exist maybe you’d hear our excuse me’s and would move accordingly. It happens too often to be just a coincidence. You’re taught you don’t have to move while, we’re taught good manners to avoid your wrath. Could you all please work on being more self-aware and more aware of our efforts to move politely throughout the world? We’d appreciate.Act like our saviors on the interweb. I know you’re used to saving us. Many of you have been taught early White people need to correct us non-White people because we are genetically inferior. We have our own minds; we have our own thoughts, and we see your actions and behaviors differently. Some of us don’t see you all as saviors, we see you as problems and major obstacles to progress upward mobility, and equality. Your savior views aren’t the right views, just White views.White people will flip out on us in a heartbeat, like as soon as we call them out for their racism or centering Whiteness. It’s always shocking. Always hurtful, but always expected. I’m shocked when a White person doesn’t get angry and/or flip out. It shows us you’re matured in your anti-racism walk.Closing doors in my face. It doesn’t matter if you hurry and up so the door can close in my face. I’m STILL coming into that space behind you. Your racist little microaggressions don’t go unnoticed. It signals you don’t respect me and you are not conscious of my being because I’m not White. We get the picture.Show their children anything non-White is bad/strange. I see how your kids act when you haven’t exposed them to “different” people enough. They act like they’ve seen a ghost when I get close to them. Heavens forbid if I speak or smile. Your kids act like I’m getting ready to kidnap them or like my Black may rub off. They act just the way you taught them to. Your kids look at me and other Black folks in fear like we’re aliens. Visit places of color and interact with people from different ethnic groups to become true global citizens.Don’t listen, can’t hear either. Self explanatory. You don’t listen to anyone except White people, even if they are wrong, because you only respect the voices and views of White people. When non-White people try to tell you how we feel, just be quiet and listen. If you’re a decent parent, would you slap your kid, watch him/her cry, tell them to shut up, then not want to hear why the kid was angry about what you did to them later on sometime? You can’t beat people down and oppress them, then expect them to be silent.Rewrite history. Some White people never see what Black people see, and they always have a different version of our national history, especially how this nation has treated non-White people.Talk to us disrespectfully online. Can’t tell you how tired I am of White women and men calling me crazy, reinterpreting my words, creating new definitions for the dictionaries their own people created, and talking to me and other Black people in ways we aren’t taught to speak to other adults. Our parents teach us at an early age not to speak to White people any kind of way because we’d be beaten, killed, or imprisoned. That physical power dynamic you once held has evolved into cyber-bullying Black people online. It’s another way you show how little respect you have for others and how much privilege you posses. Some of you White men are extremely condescending, and we know you do it intentionally to intimidate and bully.Put money over humanity. Many White people choose their money over humanity. You’ll get on television and boldly share you will support anyone who will help you get richer, even if that person is for killing your Black or Brown neighbors and co-workers. It’s hard to unsee how quickly White folks will stab a Black in the back for the potential of growing $5,000 in imaginary money in a 401K, then turn around and tell us they believe in equal rights and fairness. That’s cognitive dissonance buddy. America’s obsessions with wealth is bringing us down. You can’t consume or retire your way out of this mess.Ask me to trust you. You consistently ask me to trust you and your leadership choices when you know they don’t care about me or my issues. Every time we Black folks trust White people to do the right thing for us when they have power or are in positions of trust, they find a way to benefit from that position for personal or collective gain. White people often benefit from our suffering caused by inequality, and they seem unfazed about it. It’s hard to trust with the history we have together and the lack of effort to stop doing the things that create distrust. There are some good, trustworthy White people in the world. You need to stop being bullied and shamed by the bad people. Speak up.Strongly suggest who we should vote for. We used to vote to make you happy, but we’re learning our interests are really different from your. Some of you vote in ways that harm us directly and indirectly. You all even vote to hurt yourselves as long as someone you dislike is hurt in the process. Again, how can we trust your decisions if you all just bark orders without taking into consideration what we need? Inequality makes us see things differently. When we start seeing you make sacrifices instead of calculated risks politically and financially, perhaps we will begin to feel better about your decision-making.Forget my name. Funny how you can remember the pretty White girl’s name and face, but me, not so much. Love that. I just love that. We either all look alike or you’ve been conditioned by your sanitized environments to believe if it’s a Black face, it’s not important. We remember you, but for different reasons. Sometimes it’s for our own protection or because we must rely on you. I used to go to church with White folks Sunday who would hug me on Sunday and walk right past me in Walmart afterwards like they didn’t know me. If having relationships with Black people matters to you, remembering our faces and names would really help.Asking me for help when I’m trying to shopping. I am not the help. Before you open your mouths to ask me where something is in the store, look at my clothes, look at the purse on my arm, look to see I don’t have store frocks on my butt for goodness sake. Go look around or go find someone who looks like they actually belong to the store instead of assuming every Brown face works to serve you. I see White people do it all the time.Sometimes I really wonder what’s on your mind when ya’ll do that old antebellum mess. I know you may feel it’s not a big deal, but there is a history behind your actions. Ask yourselves why you stop to ask the Black or Brown people first.Whitesplain. Please stop. I know what I think. I know how to speak. I know what I want to say. I know how I feel. Don’t tell me how to do any of these things and please don’t challenge me if I don’t see eye to eye with you. It’s okay for us to disagree, and we know that’s very hard for many White people to accept. Sometimes you should just move on instead of injecting yourselves into Black conversations if you can’t add value. We don’t need you to come redirecting traffic to recenter everything on you. Besides, you make people not want to engage which encourages ignorance. It also silences minorities who would love to talk too. I love healthy dialogue. I like disagreement. I dislike how some of you speak to me, your tone, and your need to micromanage our words and thoughts.Backstabbing and ignoring me in the workplace. I have never worked on a job where White women haven’t stabbed me in my back, stole my ideas, sabotaged my nonprofit, or undermined me when I was a supervisor. Never. Women are the biggest workplace bullies because their indirect shenanigans go unseen or tolerated as women just being women. White women you’re the icing on the bully cake too often.Too many of you think you don’t have to answer to Black women or respect us, and you’d rather tear us down than to help a sister out. I also hate when I suggest something and it’s ignored by a group of White people, but when White Bob or White Jane suggests the same thing, you all hear it and think it’s a wonderful idea. It shows you don’t listen to or hear Black people in your White spaces. Backstabbing in the workplace creates inequality and division. It’s evil too. Just stop please.Suspect and harass us. I’m riding on the elevator and here comes Elevator Ellen telling another White women on the elevator she needed to be careful. Ain’t I a woman? We can hardly do anything or go anywhere without being suspected of something. You’ve been trained to gaze us differently. Please retrain yourselves.Ignore the diversity and inclusions initiatives you create. Nothing pisses me off more than White people creating workplace and program initiatives to bring more diversity and inclusion, then you all undermine your own diversity and inclusion efforts by engaging in tokenism and allowing White people to be overtly racist without being checked. Diversity does not address equality/inequality in pay or hiring. We’re tired of your performative diversity and inclusion efforts. It’s not improving the pay gap. Either you’re for equality or not. Intentionally sprinkling Black and Brown people around the office isn’t doing anything to achieve equality. It’s just making a white space a little dingy.Engage in tokenism in television and entertainment. If I had a dollar for every time, I watched a television show with a truckload of White people and only one little Black or Brown person, I’d be rich. Tokenism is the equivalent of the diversity and inclusion illusion. While you’re busy being colorblind, I can see your lack of color inclusion in your lives. When I see tokenism in action on my television or hear it on my radio, I know immediately who wrote the script for it. Period. One in a sea of White is not diversity. It’s tokenism.Appropriate our culture. Many of you hate our Black and Brown skins, but you love our words, our slang, music, food, and styles. Nothing burns me up more than seeing your children disrespecting and fearing us saying we’re bad, but you’ll allow the to wear the same clothes, hats, and shoes we wear, the way we wear them. I’m saddened by your kids using Black slang from our music, and yet you teach them we are inferior, you teach the to disrespect culture. You teach them it’s okay to cross the line to look like they hang around Black kids but they don’t really have to. Funny how we’re bad for you until we’re good for you.Get scared if too many Black people are in any space you’re in. You should see your faces. Watching your unnecessary angst is hilarious. They way you hold on to your kids, and all the extra stuff you do to prepare to come to our spaces is too much. If you came around more often, you wouldn’t be so afraid. We’re not afraid when we must venture into your spaces even though you guys do a lot to keep intimidate the hell out of us when we’re there. Go get some therapy. Attend anti-racism trainings. Go to Black spaces. Get some Black friends and go sit in their homes. Read White anti-racism authors like Robin DiAngelo, Tim Wise, or the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Teaching Tolerance. Face your fears, don’t hide from them.Not speak when I live in your neighborhood. I know many of you hate to see us move in to your little neighborhoods still in 2020 because you’ve been taught we make your community’s value go down. Who came up with that bullshit? I wave like a good neighbor, and ya’ll be acting like I’m not there. How Un-State Farm of you. As long as you all are hoarding up all the tax money from property taxes and determining which communities get the best stuff, we are coming. So move over, smile, and wave or learn how to share resources so we all have the same things.The list of White people things is much longer than this. I just have to stop because people have short-attention spans and a limited amount of time to spend reading. If you made it this far, I’m sure you’re pissed. If you are, that’s nice. Remember that feelings the next time you see one of us sharing spaces with you.If you have things to add to this list, regardless of your race or role, please do. Let’s talk it out. Equality starts with the small things, like changing your mindset so that it’s easier to behave differently. Actions speak louder than words.And for those of you who may read this and need to defend and/or dismiss these behaviors as rude White people just being rude White people, please kindly read my accompanying piece below “The Privilege of Being An Asshole Without Consequences.” Many people of color don’t get the privilege of being an asshole. Please understand your privileges, examine your behavior, and if necessary, act accordingly. It’s a matter of public health.https://medium.com/marleyisms/privilege-of-being-an-asshole-without-consequences-398fa5523182MarleyWritten by"
20,Learn How To Focus Like The Pros,"I can’t count how many times I’ve heard people make excuses for their attention span. “My attention span is, like, two seconds.” “I’m just so ADHD.” “I can’t just sit down and work for six hours in a row.” “I’m like a squirrel — hey look, squirrel!” Our culture sees our attention spans as something fixed, immutable, like hair color and eye color: something you either have or don’t have.Like most of our cultural narratives, this is total bullshit. The reason you can’t focus is that no one ever taught you how.One thing not many people know about me is that I was raised in a household with two autistic brothers. I don’t mean a little autistic — you know, a little awkward, social delays, periodic obsessions — I mean a lot autistic. My childhood memories are not of going to soccer practice, but of sitting in the waiting rooms of speech therapy clinics for my brothers. The state sent medical professionals to our house for four to six hours a day, five to seven days a week, to teach one of my brothers basic skills, skills like using the bathroom and asking for food. As a result, I knew more about how to live with intellectual and mental disabilities by age 12 than many medical professionals themselves do.The one lesson this taught me, more than any other, is that there is always a workaround. If he couldn’t form the words to ask for food, my parents could print out little pictures of his favorite foods he could point to. If he couldn’t figure out the name of the movie he wanted to watch, my mother could teach him how to put in the tapes himself. If he couldn’t stomach store-bought chicken nuggets, my grandparents could make him chicken nuggets that wouldn’t upset his stomach.In the medical parlance, these are called interventions — specialists intervening on behalf of the disabled person.So when I started displaying symptoms of ADHD around age 13 — an inability to remember my class schedule, let alone my homework assignments, a constant fidgety feeling in class, the nasty habit of reading a book for ten hours straight and forgetting to eat and go to the bathroom —I didn’t ask a parent for help. I didn’t tell my teachers I couldn’t remember what the assignment was. The solution was obvious: develop a workaround. So at age 13, I became the only student with a day planner, calendar, and to-do list.My friends called me a nerd. My teachers thought I was just so responsible (until I brought a Palm Pilot to class — then they called me a distraction). I didn’t know what was wrong with me; I knew I didn’t care about school all that much, but I didn’t know how to tell anyone that I needed my hyper-organized binders and my day planner and my todo list and my Palm Pilot or I was going to melt down. It was eight years before a therapist correctly identified these as good interventions for severe ADHD.By then, of course, I had already realized. Not only have I been using a calendar and to-do list since age 13, I’ve been using a matrix of coping mechanisms since my early adulthood:I’m sure there’s more… if only I could remember them.These interventions work — for people with ADHD, and for anyone — because they reduce the load on your working memory.Working memory is a cognitive system with a limited capacity that is responsible for temporarily holding information available for processing. Working memory is important for reasoning and the guidance of decision-making and behavior. Working memory is often used synonymously with short-term memory, but some theorists consider the two forms of memory distinct, assuming that working memory allows for the manipulation of stored information, whereas short-term memory only refers to the short-term storage of information. — Wikipedia, Working MemoryWhen someone asks you to remember some numbers, that’s a load on your working memory. When you just remember everything you need to get done in your head, that’s a load on your working memory. When you just remember your schedule in your head instead of putting it in your calendar, that’s a load on your working memory.The bad news is that your working memory is not infinite. Like RAM on a computer, too much information packed in your working memory will cause space shortages. Eventually, data gets deleted. For your working memory to perform well, it needs the most space possible. When people keep to-do lists, calendars, and binders of information, that’s what they’re doing — freeing up their working memory for more important things.Unfortunately, our brains didn’t evolve for modern life. The demand modern environments place on our working memory is incredible. In addition to the normal todos, scheduled events, and information you need to remember, there’s sensory information like:To get even a minimally acceptable level of performance out of your working memory, you have to fight a torrent of stimuli. In modern society, nobody has a long attention span unless they do what it takes to have one.So, when I hear people complain about their ability to focus, to remember names, to remember things they need to get done, I immediately take a look at them and ask myself “what interventions are they using?”When people tell me they have the attention span of a fish, the first thing I ask myself is if they have a to-do list or a calendar. If they don’t, I think “no, your attention span is fine” — because if your attention span is short and you don’t have a calendar and to-do list, you will have a hard time getting your life together.The first (and most basic) thing you can do to increase your ability to focus is getting a to-do list and a calendar and using them every day.Of all the ways modern life is distracting, the phone is clearly the champion — your phone processes hundreds of notifications a day, all of them constantly vying for your attention.So, if you tell me you have the attention span of a fish and I see your phone’s lock screen is completely filled with notifications, I am going to think the only reason you’re distracted is that you let yourself be distracted.If you want to be able to focus, turn your phone notifications off. Like, all of them. Not just when you’re working, but all the time. The only notifications I get for my phone are for:That’s it. No games, no social media (in fact, I deleted all of it), no news, no podcasts, no nothing. I can’t afford to have my phone distracting me when I’m trying to focus.Everything you own produces a cognitive load. Every possession you own is something you have to look at, think about, process, clean, rearrange, and take care of. And like your phone notifications, you don’t notice the cognitive load until it’s completely out of your control.For maximum working memory, own only things you use regularly. You don’t have to pare down all your possessions to one backpack James Altucher style, but you should be able to fit all your possessions in your own home without the aid of walk-in-closets, complicated closet systems from The Container Store, or an external storage unit. That’s not minimalism, that’s common sense.What’s also important is that things are out of sight; we operate at peak capacity when we have a clean, uncluttered, simple space that allows us to focus on what’s in front of us (instead of the random clutter around us). If you can put all your papers, books, clothes, and possessions either away in drawers or organized on shelves, your working memory will thank you.P.S. If you have anything sitting around the house you are going to donate, resell, or “fix up,” either get it done or get rid of them. Items like this are just physical to-dos, distracting you with their needs every time you lay eyes on them. Remove the distraction once and for all.Just like how your phone notifications cause sensory overload, your email does as well. It’s hard to know what you’ve got going on in your life when your inbox is an endless pile of things you haven’t dealt with. The good news is, cleaning out your email is simple business:These are common ways people ease the load on their working memory, but they are not the only ways. Anything in your life that represents something you have to keep track of, for five minutes or five months, is something weighing on your working memory. The easier you can make it on your working memory, the better.Your working memory will not instantaneously improve the moment you start doing these things. If anything, your working memory will get worse — now you have to remember to update your todo list and calendar, check your phone manually, etc. These habits will take time to build. But after two or three weeks, the habits will stick, and your working memory will increase dramatically.This is because, like your muscles, your working memory needs to be trained. It doesn’t improve or get worse instantaneously. Instead, it needs time and space to grow.In “How to Remove Facebook From Your Life,” writer Dan Silvestre notes how deleting his Facebook account produced an increase in his own working memory:Similarly how smokers breath better every week after they quit, the increase in my attention span was incremental. At first, it was hard to focus for more than a handful minutes on a task. Gradually, it became easier and I am now a lot better at doing Deep Work for a longer period of time.My own story is somewhat similar. Over the course of a few months…Then I noticed something happened all on its own, like a miracle from heaven — I could remember people’s names. All my life, I couldn’t remember to even feed myself, let alone remember people’s names, and suddenly now I’m the person everyone asks for name reminders. In fact, the original title for this article was “How To Always Remember People’s Names.”But it’s not just names. I can remember all kinds of things. I remember new people’s names the first time. I remember where my boyfriend put his keys when he came in the house. I remember the great idea I had in the shower. I remember the way to get out of neighborhoods I’ve never been to before. My God, I remember.When I combine all my newly-available working memory with the hours of time I’ve reclaimed from my phone and social media and email, my productivity goes insane.It’s not because I’m so smart, or super-motivated, or blessed with a neurotypical brain (I’m arguably smart, but I’m not always motivated and I’m definitely not neurotypical). It’s because, instead of just consigning myself to a life with a poor attention span, I did something about it.The good news is, if a woman with ADHD so severe she forgets to eat can figure out how to get hours of uninterrupted productivity on a regular basis, so can you.If you want more articles like this, sign up for my weekly digest.Click to join Megan’s Weekly Digest today.Written by"
21,"9 Free Programming Courses by Harvard, MIT, IBM, Google, and Microsoft","A traditional degree can be costly, especially if you’re thinking about a career change or don’t want to rack up a large student loan. While community colleges and local institutions tend to be much lower in cost, you might be unsure about such a long-term commitment or have family-related logistics to coordinate. Or maybe you just want to formally upgrade your skills without taking three years off.Here are nine courses where you can learn coding for free. The best part is that you can also get certified by ivy league institutes or industry leaders like Google, AWS, Microsoft, and IBM.For the courses listed here, learning the content and completing the associated materials is often free but getting the accreditation for it can cost a little, depending on the provider and institution.Course by HarvardX.This certificate contains one course that’s broken up into two parts. Both parts are free. The price of a verified certificate is about the same as a week’s worth of groceries for one person, so it’s not too bad.The first part covers the introductory component to web programming and touches on C, Python, SQL, JavaScript, CSS and HTML. The second part deals with more in-depth topics and includes Git, using APIs, SQL, scalability, testing, and various front end technologies.All in all, the entire course can be completed in approximately 20 weeks. But, because it’s self-paced, it can be completed faster.Course by HarvardX.This is another professional certificate by Harvard University via EdX. The first part of this course is the same as above — the second half sends you down a mobile application specialty with React Native.If you’re looking specifically to get into front end development, the previously listed course is better suited. But if you’re looking to have cross-functional skills with mobile development, then this track may be right for you.Whatever you end up choosing, you can still do the other path in conjunction since the content will eventually crop up in real-life scenarios.Course by Microsoft.This course is a bit more expensive to complete. However, it consists of 11 different courses with a focus on Python. Each course has its own certified certificate, with all 11 adding up to a professional certificate from Microsoft.It’s self-paced and the expected workload is approximately 4–6 hours per week — or an hour a night if you’re looking to slowly digest the content. Because it’s self-paced you can finish it faster if you have more time you can devote to it.The course includes deep learning, ethics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.Course by Microsoft.This certification consists of three courses and deals mainly with Python. The program is aimed at absolute beginners, which means that you’re not expected to know anything at all about programming.It’s 100% self-paced and you can work through the program without needing to pay anything for access.If you’re looking for a starting foundational course, the free content in this one can help kickstart your career in tech. However, it’s important to note that this course is very Python-centric — which isn’t a bad thing, but if you’re looking for a general course, perhaps because your mind is better suited to generalist ways of learning, then the Harvard courses may be better for you.Course by Massachusetts Institute of Technology.This is another beginner course, aimed at people who want to get started and test the waters with programming but don’t know where to start.The length of time required to complete this program (estimated at 5 months 14–16 hours per week commitment) suggests that the program is meatier in content.The program overview says that you don’t need prior experience in computer science-related subjects and topics to get started. This means you’ll learn the important concepts that make up the foundation of computational thinking.Course by Google Cloud.Cloud computing is the flavor of the coming decade and this course was created by Google to help you understand and work with their technologies.You’ll learn about infrastructure, the core services Google offers, how they work, as well as concepts and theories about cloud computing.This course is suited for those who already have some programming skills and want to upgrade into a true full-stack developer.Just because they can boot up something in the cloud, it doesn’t instantly make you a true full-stack developer. Cloud infrastructure and architecture is a complex creature, as complex as all the other parts of development work, and this certification track can bolster your knowledge and make you a better full stack developer.Course by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.The courses in this track are part of their Master in Computer Science degree. However, the content track for this certification is geared toward becoming an expert in cloud computing theories and technologies.It also touches on big data and how to deal with it in the cloud.This track is not for beginners and is better suited to those who already have experience in development work and maybe some years working with applications. It’s more of an upgrading of skill and knowledge.Course by IBM.This course is created by IBM and aimed at beginners looking to get a better understanding of cybersecurity and how application building processes work.The course content deals with security protocols, cybersecurity frameworks, and how cyber-attacks happen.Security is often one of the last things on people’s minds — until something happens. Then the magnificent Captain Hindsight kicks in! Having a good foundation in security that can help prevent these kinds of occurrences.You don’t have to be a coder to start this program, or even be looking to learn how to code. Rather, this course is suitable for all, regardless of your current discipline.Course by University at Buffalo and The State University of New York.Who isn’t talking about blockchain nowadays? It’s everywhere. But the issue with blockchain is that while there’s a lot of hype, a lot of people don’t really know what it is, what it does, or how it works.This is your chance to upgrade your skillset and get started on something that’s being touted as the next frontier of technology. It’s a different way of thinking about programming and how to create applications.Blockchain is a revolution in action and this is your opportunity to be part of it.Taking a structured course can help you get out of the self-taught route and take you out of the tutorial rut by giving you a structure to topics and idea paths that you may not be aware of.The main perk of the courses listed above is that they’re all free. That means that unless you want the certificate for showing purposes, the knowledge itself is free. The only cost is the initial time investment you put in.Becoming a crafter of code is a constant act of learning. It doesn’t matter where you are in your journey right now, learning is an activity that all the best developers have in common.Edit: For people who are saying there are no links, click on the title of the course.

22,Building a Simple Chatbot from Scratch in Python (using NLTK),"Gartner estimates that by 2020, chatbots will be handling 85 percent of customer-service interactions; they are already handling about 30 percent of transactions now.I am sure you’ve heard about Duolingo: a popular language-learning app, which gamifies practicing a new language. It is quite popular due to its innovative styles of teaching a foreign language.The concept is simple: five to ten minutes of interactive training a day is enough to learn a language.However, even though Duolingo is enabling people to learn a new language, it’s practitioners had a concern. People felt they were missing out on learning valuable conversational skills since they were learning on their own. People were also apprehensive about being paired with other language learners due to fear of embarrassment. This was turning out be a big bottleneck in Duolingo’s plans.So their team solved this problem by building a native chatbot within its app, to help users learn conversational skills and practice what they learned.Since the bots are designed as conversational and friendly, Duolingo learners can practice conversation any time of the day, using their choice of characters, until they feel brave enough to practice their new language with other speakers. This solved a major consumer pain point and made learning through the app a lot more fun.A chatbot is an artificial intelligence-powered piece of software in a device (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant etc), application, website or other networks that try to gauge consumer’s needs and then assist them to perform a particular task like a commercial transaction, hotel booking, form submission etc . Today almost every company has a chatbot deployed to engage with the users. Some of the ways in which companies are using chatbots are:The possibilities are (almost) limitless.History of chatbots dates back to 1966 when a computer program called ELIZA was invented by Weizenbaum. It imitated the language of a psychotherapist from only 200 lines of code. You can still converse with it here: Eliza.There are broadly two variants of chatbots: Rule-Based and Self-learning.i) In retrieval-based models, a chatbot uses some heuristic to select a response from a library of predefined responses. The chatbot uses the message and context of the conversation for selecting the best response from a predefined list of bot messages. The context can include a current position in the dialogue tree, all previous messages in the conversation, previously saved variables (e.g. username). Heuristics for selecting a response can be engineered in many different ways, from rule-based if-else conditional logic to machine learning classifiers.ii) Generative bots can generate the answers and not always replies with one of the answers from a set of answers. This makes them more intelligent as they take word by word from the query and generates the answers.In this article we will build a simple retrieval based chatbot based on NLTK library in python.Hands-On knowledge of scikit library and NLTK is assumed. However, if you are new to NLP, you can still read the article and then refer back to resources.The field of study that focuses on the interactions between human language and computers is called Natural Language Processing, or NLP for short. It sits at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics[Wikipedia].NLP is a way for computers to analyze, understand, and derive meaning from human language in a smart and useful way. By utilizing NLP, developers can organize and structure knowledge to perform tasks such as automatic summarization, translation, named entity recognition, relationship extraction, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and topic segmentation.NLTK(Natural Language Toolkit) is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries.NLTK has been called “a wonderful tool for teaching and working in, computational linguistics using Python,” and “an amazing library to play with natural language.”Natural Language Processing with Python provides a practical introduction to programming for language processing. I highly recommend this book to people beginning in NLP with Python.Downloading and installing NLTKFor platform-specific instructions, read here.import NLTK and run nltk.download().This will open the NLTK downloader from where you can choose the corpora and models to download. You can also download all packages at once.The main issue with text data is that it is all in text format (strings). However, Machine learning algorithms need some sort of numerical feature vector in order to perform the task. So before we start with any NLP project we need to pre-process it to make it ideal for work. Basic text pre-processing includes:The NLTK data package includes a pre-trained Punkt tokenizer for English.After the initial preprocessing phase, we need to transform the text into a meaningful vector (or array) of numbers. The bag-of-words is a representation of text that describes the occurrence of words within a document. It involves two things:•A vocabulary of known words.•A measure of the presence of known words.Why is it is called a “bag” of words? That is because any information about the order or structure of words in the document is discarded and the model is only concerned with whether the known words occur in the document, not where they occur in the document.The intuition behind the Bag of Words is that documents are similar if they have similar content. Also, we can learn something about the meaning of the document from its content alone.For example, if our dictionary contains the words {Learning, is, the, not, great}, and we want to vectorize the text “Learning is great”, we would have the following vector: (1, 1, 0, 0, 1).A problem with the Bag of Words approach is that highly frequent words start to dominate in the document (e.g. larger score), but may not contain as much “informational content”. Also, it will give more weight to longer documents than shorter documents.One approach is to rescale the frequency of words by how often they appear in all documents so that the scores for frequent words like “the” that are also frequent across all documents are penalized. This approach to scoring is called Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, or TF-IDF for short, where:Term Frequency: is a scoring of the frequency of the word in the current document.Inverse Document Frequency: is a scoring of how rare the word is across documents.Tf-IDF weight is a weight often used in information retrieval and text mining. This weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpusExample:Consider a document containing 100 words wherein the word ‘phone’ appears 5 times.The term frequency (i.e., tf) for phone is then (5 / 100) = 0.05. Now, assume we have 10 million documents and the word phone appears in one thousand of these. Then, the inverse document frequency (i.e., IDF) is calculated as log(10,000,000 / 1,000) = 4. Thus, the Tf-IDF weight is the product of these quantities: 0.05 * 4 = 0.20.Tf-IDF can be implemented in scikit learn as:from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizerTF-IDF is a transformation applied to texts to get two real-valued vectors in vector space. We can then obtain the Cosine similarity of any pair of vectors by taking their dot product and dividing that by the product of their norms. That yields the cosine of the angle between the vectors. Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors. Using this formula we can find out the similarity between any two documents d1 and d2.where d1,d2 are two non zero vectors.For a detailed explanation and practical example of TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity refer to the document below.Now we have a fair idea of the NLP process. It is time that we get to our real task i.e Chatbot creation. We will name the chatbot here as ‘ROBO🤖’.You can find the entire code with the corpus at the associated Github Repository here or you can view it on my binder by clicking the image below.For our example, we will be using the Wikipedia page for chatbots as our corpus. Copy the contents from the page and place it in a text file named ‘chatbot.txt’. However, you can use any corpus of your choice.We will read in the corpus.txt file and convert the entire corpus into a list of sentences and a list of words for further pre-processing.Let see an example of the sent_tokens and the word_tokensWe shall now define a function called LemTokens which will take as input the tokens and return normalized tokens.Next, we shall define a function for a greeting by the bot i.e if a user’s input is a greeting, the bot shall return a greeting response.ELIZA uses a simple keyword matching for greetings. We will utilize the same concept here.To generate a response from our bot for input questions, the concept of document similarity will be used. So we begin by importing the necessary modules.This will be used to find the similarity between words entered by the user and the words in the corpus. This is the simplest possible implementation of a chatbot.We define a function response which searches the user’s utterance for one or more known keywords and returns one of several possible responses. If it doesn’t find the input matching any of the keywords, it returns a response:” I am sorry! I don’t understand you”Finally, we will feed the lines that we want our bot to say while starting and ending a conversation depending upon the user’s input.So that’s pretty much it. We have coded our first chatbot in NLTK. Now, let us see how it interacts with humans:This wasn’t too bad. Even though the chatbot couldn’t give a satisfactory answer for some questions, it fared pretty well on others.Though it is a very simple bot with hardly any cognitive skills, its a good way to get into NLP and get to know about chatbots.Though ‘ROBO’ responds to user input. It won’t fool your friends, and for a production system you’ll want to consider one of the existing bot platforms or frameworks, but this example should help you think through the design and challenge of creating a chatbot. Internet is flooded with resources and after reading this article I am sure , you will want to create a chatbot of your own. So happy tinkering!!Written by"
23,A Simple Guide On Using BERT for Binary Text Classification.,"In light of the update to the library used in this article (HuggingFace updated the pytorch-pretrained-bert library to pytorch-transformers), I have written a new guide as well as a new repo. If you are starting out with Transformer models, I recommend using those as the code has been cleaned up both on my end and in the Pytorch-Transformers library, greatly streamlining the whole process. The new repo also supports XLNet, XLM, and RoBERTa models out of the box, in addition to BERT, as of September 2019.That said, everything in this article, and its accompanying repo, still work as intended for anyone wishing to use them.Before we begin, let me point you towards the github repo containing all the code used in this guide. All code in the repo is included in the guide here, and vice versa. Feel free to refer to it anytime, or clone the repo to follow along with the guide.If your internet wanderings have led you here, I guess it’s safe to assume that you have heard of BERT, the powerful new language representation model, open-sourced by Google towards the end of 2018. If you haven’t, or if you’d like a refresher, I recommend giving their paper a read as I won’t be going into the technical details of how BERT works. If you are unfamiliar with the Transformer model (or if words like “attention”, “embeddings”, and “encoder-decoder” sound scary), check out this brilliant article by Jay Alammar. You don’t necessarily need to know everything about BERT (or Transformers) to follow the rest of this guide, but the above links should help if you wish to learn more about BERT and Transformers.Now that we’ve gotten what we won’t do out of the way, let’s dig into what we will do, shall we?One last thing before we dig in, I’ll be using three Jupyter Notebooks for data preparation, training, and evaluation. It’s not strictly necessary, but it felt cleaner to separate those three processes.Most datasets you find will typically come in the csv format and the Yelp Reviews dataset is no exception. Let’s load it in with pandas and take a look.As you can see, the data is in the two csv files train.csv and test.csv. They contain no headers, and two columns for the label and the text. The labels used here feel a little weird to me, as they have used 1 and 2 instead of the typical 0 and 1. Here, a label of 1 means the review is bad, and a label of 2 means the review is good. I’m going to change this to the more familiar 0 and 1 labelling, where a label 0 indicates a bad review, and a label 1 indicates a good review.BERT, however, wants data to be in a tsv file with a specific format as given below (Four columns, and no header row).Let’s make things a little BERT-friendly.For convenience, I’ve named the test data as dev data. The convenience stems from the fact that BERT comes with data loading classes that expects train and dev files in the above format. We can use the train data to train our model, and the dev data to evaluate its performance. BERT’s data loading classes can also use a test file but it expects the test file to be unlabelled. Therefore, I will be using the train and dev files instead.Now that we have the data in the correct form, all we need to do is to save the train and dev data as .tsv files.That’s the eggs beaten, the chicken thawed, and the veggies sliced. Let’s get cooking!Now, we will see the reason for us rearranging the data into the .tsv format in the previous section. It enables us to easily reuse the example classes that come with BERT for our own binary classification task. Here’s how they look.The first class, InputExample, is the format that a single example of our dataset should be in. We won’t be using the text_b attribute since that is not necessary for our binary classification task. The other attributes should be fairly self-explanatory.The other two classes, DataProcessor and BinaryClassificationProcessor, are helper classes that can be used to read in .tsv files and prepare them to be converted into features that will ultimately be fed into the actual BERT model.The BinaryClassificationProcessor class can read in the train.tsv and dev.tsv files and convert them into lists of InputExample objects.So far, we have the capability to read in tsv datasets and convert them into InputExample objects. BERT, being a neural network, cannot directly deal with text as we have in InputExample objects. The next step is to convert them into InputFeatures.BERT has a constraint on the maximum length of a sequence after tokenizing. For any BERT model, the maximum sequence length after tokenization is 512. But we can set any sequence length equal to or below this value. For faster training, I’ll be using 128 as the maximum sequence length. A bigger number may give better results if there are sequences longer than this value.An InputFeature consists of purely numerical data (with the proper sequence lengths) that can then be fed into the BERT model. This is prepared by tokenizing the text of each example and truncating the longer sequence while padding the shorter sequences to the given maximum sequence length (128). I found the conversion of InputExample objects to InputFeature objects to be quite slow by default, so I modified the conversion code to utilize the multiprocessing library of Python to significantly speed up the process.We will see how to use these methods in just a bit.(Note: I’m switching to the training notebook.)First, let’s import all the packages that we’ll need, and then get our paths straightened out.In the first cell, we are importing the necessary packages. In the next cell, we are setting some paths for where files should be stored and where certain files can be found. We are also setting some configuration options for the BERT model. Finally, we will create the directories if they do not already exist.Next, we will use our BinaryClassificationProcessor to load in the data, and get everything ready for the tokenization step.Here, we are creating our BinaryClassificationProcessor and using it to load in the train examples. Then, we are setting some variables that we’ll use while training the model. Next, we are loading the pretrained tokenizer by BERT. In this case, we’ll be using the bert-base-cased model.The convert_example_to_feature function expects a tuple containing an example, the label map, the maximum sequence length, a tokenizer, and the output mode. So lastly, we will create an examples list ready to be processed (tokenized, truncated/padded, and turned into InputFeatures) by the convert_example_to_feature function.Now, we can use the multi-core goodness of modern CPU’s to process the examples (relatively) quickly. My Ryzen 7 2700x took about one and a half hours for this part.(Note: If you have any issues getting the multiprocessing to work, just copy paste all the code up to, and including, the multiprocessing into a python script and run it from the command line or an IDE. Jupyter Notebooks can sometimes get a little iffy with multiprocessing. I’ve included an example script on github named converter.py)Once all the examples are converted into features, we can pickle them to disk for safekeeping (I, for one, do not want to run the processing for another one and a half hours). Next time, you can just unpickle the file to get the list of features.Well, that was a lot of data preparation. You deserve a coffee, I’ll see you for the training part in a bit. (Unless you already had your coffee while the processing was going on. In which case, kudos to efficiency!)Not much left now, let’s hope for smooth sailing. (Or smooth.. cooking? I forgot my analogy somewhere along the way. Anyway, we now have all the ingredients in the pot, and all we have to do is turn on the stove and let thermodynamics work its magic.)HuggingFace’s pytorch implementation of BERT comes with a function that automatically downloads the BERT model for us (have I mentioned I love these dudes?). I stopped my download since I have terrible internet, but it shouldn’t take long. It’s only about 400 MB in total for the base models. Just wait for the download to complete and you are good to go.Don’t panic if you see the following output once the model is downloaded, I know it looks panic inducing but this is actually the expected behavior. The not initialized things are not meant to be initialized. Intentionally.(Tip: The model will be downloaded into a temporary folder. Find the folder by following the path printed on the output once the download completes and copy the downloaded file to the cache/ directory. The file should be a compressed file in .tar.gz format. Next time, you can just use this downloaded file without having to download it all over again. All you need to do is comment out the line that downloaded the model, and uncomment the line below it.)We just need to do a tiny bit more configuration for the training. Here, I’m just using the default parameters.Setting up our DataLoader for training..Training time!Now we’ve trained the BERT model for one epoch, we can evaluate the results. Of course, more training will likely yield better results but even one epoch should be sufficient for proof of concept (hopefully!).In order to be able to easily load our fine-tuned model, we should save it in a specific way, i.e. the same way the default BERT models are saved. Here is how you can do that.We will load this fine tuned model in the next step.(Note: I’m switching to the evaluation notebook)Most of the code for the evaluation is very similar to the training process, so I won’t go into too much detail but I’ll list some important points.Here’s my notebook for the evaluation.With just one single epoch of training, our BERT model achieves a 0.914 Matthews correlation coefficient (Good measure for evaluating unbalanced datasets. Sklearn doc here). With more training, and perhaps some hyperparameter tuning, we can almost certainly improve upon what is already an impressive score.BERT is an incredibly powerful language representation model that shows great promise in a wide variety of NLP tasks. Here, I’ve tried to give a basic guide to how you might use it for binary text classification.As the results show, BERT is a very effective tool for binary text classification, not to mention all the other tasks it has already been used for.Reminder: Github repo with all the code can be found here.Written by"
24,I Knew I Had To Breakup With Him When I Opened His Gift,"When Pete handed me the gift, I was hesitant. It felt like a tiny stack of note cards. The wrapping paper had nothing to grip and whatever was contained within slid around alarmingly. In an instant, I knew what he had given me.At that same moment, I decided to breakup with him.I’m a sucker for the holidays. The lights, the music, the trees, the incessant smell of cinnamon in the air, I love it all. Mostly, I enjoy exchanging gifts. I’m not one for being excessive, but finding that perfect present for your loved one is a challenge I readily accept.Had a passion for an obscure television show in your childhood? Thanks to the power of eBay, I was able to find that lunch box featuring its characters that you desired all those years ago. Do you use one pan with its “harmless” coating of rust for everything you cook? Here are a proper skillet and saucepan so you can actually make a good meal that won’t poison you or me.Yeah, I don’t mean to brag, but I’m pretty good at giving gifts.It’s not about the money. I don’t need diamonds or a $2500 exercise bike. The gift just needs to be something that proves the person cares enough to listen and watch for a way to make my life a little sweeter.Pete failed that test spectacularly that Christmas.To be fair, things were already rocky. We were in that weird phase of our relationship where we alternated staying at the other person’s place a few nights a week at a time. That much closeness is a good way to test the waters before you actually make the bigger jump and sign a lease together. It was a good thing we did so, for those waters we dipped our toes into proved rough and rocky.He was not into housework. Dishes were left out, pants remained on the floor, laundry went undone unless I took the time to be the mom. He’d been able to hide the worse of the mess by putting things out of eyesight, but now that I was actually the one opening the cupboards and closets, the problem was clear. The week before, after scrubbing the crusted remnants of tomato sauce out of a pan, I finally had it out with him. He needed to help out more because I refused to be Ms. Homemaker. He nodded, showing he understood.The next morning I found a dirty coffee cup in a bathroom cabinet.Opening the gift I looked at the small pile of 10 or so index cards. Hastily scrawled across each was a service he offered, free of charge.Pete will wash the dishes.Pete will do the laundry.Pete will vacuum.Pete will clean the windows.Pete will take out the trash.They were vouchers that I could cash in when I needed help. Only then would he deign to help me with the work he should have been splitting with me all along because it was not the 1950s anymore.He sat next to me with a smug smile, waiting for the, “Thank you,” I didn't want to give.This might seem like a cute gift, but the context was key.His gift told me, “My efforts around the house are a gift. That means those efforts will be rare and when I do anything at all, you should be very grateful.”He was never going to be an equal partner. I’d work to pay half the rent and utilities, then start my second shift when I got home, making things clean and nice so we’d both love our home. This wasn’t a deal where we’d split the duties the other person didn’t like. There was no talk of me doing all the dishes while he did the vacuuming. It was all on me. I’d do every last bit of housework unless I used one of the stupid coupons I’d just received.I thanked him. But I wasn’t thanking him for the vouchers. I was happy for the far better gift he’d unintentionally given me that night.I was thanking him for showing me who he really was, for opening my eyes to the future I would have if I stayed. My own delusions that the man next to me would be my forever-person were dashed. I wanted to be a girlfriend, not a mother to my partner.The next day, when I was grabbing the last of my belongings out of his place, I left those coupons behind for the next woman. Maybe she would find them cute and they’d get married and have 4 gorgeous children together, some of which would hopefully help her around the house.Or maybe, like me, those hand-scrawled promises to do better would prove her suspicions true, and she too would break up with him on December 26th.Thanks for reading!

25,German May Be The Language Of The Future,"Languages help seeing things from a different perspective.As a Spanish native speaker, I can say we give too much importance to sex. Every word is feminine or masculine and we fight because “non-binary” is difficult to consider in our language. When I learned English, I liked to see that nothing was sexualized.Learning German, I discovered two things so far:Through History, we could see that powerful people (kings and queens in Europe) used to speak French. Then, the Spanish increased their speakers when they colonized America.Now we live in an era where English dominates businesses. But, with the UK leaving the EU, and fights between China and the US, it is possible for German or Chinese to become the main language for business.Why do I think China growth will not last? Two reasons:On the other hand, Germany is one of the promoters of the EU. Lots of migrants that used to move to London are now moving to other European cities. Frankfurt, Paris, and Amsterdam are the cities attracting the most talent and investments.I have always wanted to learn German, I went to classes some years ago, but after 3 months I stopped going as I found it dull.Last year, I decided to try it again and I got to be constant all over the year. Do you want to know how I did it? Keep reading.Most shows on Netflix are in German: Queer eye, The Witcher, Rick and Morty, Sex Education,… you can set English subtitles to watch it. If you are brave enough, some series, like Rick and Morty, have German subtitles too.Some people consider that turning on English subtitles is bad because you read instead of listening, but it is worse if you do not do it at all because you are bored. I like to make little steps so I am engaged.I read Faust by Flix. You can buy it in Amazon. It’s a hilarious comic based on the classic Faust.I also bought Harry Potter und Die Kammer des Schreckens. I would listen the hörbuch while reading it and then read it again looking for the words I do not know.I admit I still find it difficult to read, but I love Harry Potter so much that I enjoyed reading it anyway. You should pick a book that you absolutely love to read it in german.I personally like to follow YouTube channels that show things that I am interested in. I like history, grammar, and music, so I just go into Google I search for “Deutsche Music Youtube”. Some of my favorites are:PS. you can set auto-translation to have English subtitles, the feature works quite well.Once, I downloaded a dating app and set my location to Hamburg. I started chatting with a girl and she taught me lots of words. It was easy as I had Google translator on my side.Let me know if you have started learning German and how it goes!Written by"
26,The Biggest Surprise For Us Out Of Trump’s Impeachment Trial,"Update: Interesting: we’re still watching C-SPAN, but they’ve changed their call-in system! Now instead of asking viewers to call different numbers based on their political affiliation, they’re asking them to call different numbers based on the time zone they’re in!Yes, former National Security Advisor John Bolton’s leaked revelation (but not by him, he insists!) that Trump’s conduct wasn’t “perfect” is quite a blockbuster, but that hasn’t touched the trial directly. At least not yet. Especially with Trump’s defense team proceeding largely as if the new info didn’t even exist: that Bolton writes in an upcoming book Trump did indeed tie military aid to Ukraine to a Biden investigation.What caught our attention — other than the fact that Trump’s folks, who are supposed to be such computer whizzes did a much poorer job presenting visual and audio support for their case than Democrats did last week: one of his lawyers at least, seemed to have access to a single perplexing template with silhouettes of a group of people over which to superimpose all of their graphics — was something not explicitly part of the trial itself.We watch the proceedings over on C-SPAN because we really dislike seeing and hearing from a panel of what Trump correctly characterizes as “8 people you never heard of” anytime there’s a break, regardless of where you turn.What C-SPAN does instead during breaks is take phone calls from its viewers, and while there’s some interaction with a host, it’s very minimal. Ostensibly to avoid confusion, C-SPAN asks Democrats, Republicans, and “Others” (whom its hosts more commonly refer to on the air as Independents), to call in to separate telephone numbers.Thing is, at least among Americans who actively call in to C-SPAN, at least over last week and the beginning of this week, almost everybody who self-identifies as an Independent, turns out to be a Trump supporter.One fellow, who identified himself as an Independent, took C-SPAN to task for being too cowardly to turn its cameras around to show Democrats slacking off during Trump’s lawyers’ arguments (of course, Republicans were doing the same thing last week). Also of course, the Senate controls its own cameras, not C-SPAN. C-SPAN in fact asked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for permission to get a camera or two of their own into the impeachment trial, specifically to get reaction shots (quite possibly of the type the “Independent” on the phone was talking about). McConnell said no.According to Gallup, as of this month 45% of voters in the U.S. self-identify as Independents. That’s close to the highest percentage ever. Conveniently, Democrats and Republicans are equally split 27%-27%. Which isn’t convenient for Democrats: they’ve historically had an edge in party registration, even in years when Republicans have won the Presidency. And the 27% who are Republicans are almost singular in their support for Trump (as he continually likes to point out), and who will almost certainly vote. The same can’t be said of the 27% of Americans who are avowed Democrats, who at best are like herding cats.Which means we’re looking at an eventuality that may be very similar to the last Presidential election: due to an uneven split among Independents, and the greater weight of the electoral vs. popular vote, a Democratic candidate might have to be polling about 10 points ahead on Election Day in order to win by a slim margin. (None of the Democratic candidates has that kind of lead over Trump in a head-to-head match-up right now. Hillary Clinton actually did, up until then-FBI Director James Comey came out and announced a second email investigation, just a few days before the election. But we know better than to go any further down that path.)At least, as we said, if Independents are accurately represented by those calling in to C-SPAN any time the Senate takes a break.Written by"

28,"Google’s New Chatbot, Aerial Surveillance, and Rooting Robots: The Week’s Most Interesting ArXiv Papers","Researchers publish hundreds of new A.I. research papers every week on arXiv, an online repository for scientific papers. Here are a few that we found interesting, and think you might, too.Google built a chatbot called Meena that was trained on 40 billion words of conversation captured from social media. Meena supposedly outperforms chatbots like Cleverbot and Microsoft’s Xiaoice by focusing on a simple metric: a crowd worker’s decision of whether its responses “makes sense.”A new approach to robotic manipulation allows a robot arm to root around, find a hidden object, and pick it up — much like the famed truffle hogs. This has obvious applications in an Amazon warehouse, where items might be dropped or buried in bins… but let’s focus on the truffle opportunities here.Today in aerial surveillance: a new way to recognize cars from satellite imagery.Bees, hornets, and mosquitoes can give scientists insight into the overall health of an ecosystem, and an international cadre of A.I. researchers have turned that idea into an app. The free app automatically recognizes different species of insect for the user, and uploads information of where they were sighted to researchers. It was an unexpected hit: users uploaded more than 44,000 images.Geoff Hinton, often credited for pioneering the math behind neural networks used in modern A.I., debuted a new algorithmic model called capsule networks in 2017. (Read how they work here.) A new paper suggests that capsule networks are better at understanding minute differences between objects than the algorithms used today.Written by"
29,Minimalism Is a Luxury Good,"Maybe it started with the iconoclastic act of throwing tea off the boat in Boston Harbor, or perhaps with the misperception that North America was simply a blank space before the pilgrims came from England and the pioneers headed West. In any case, the United States is particularly vulnerable to the charms of minimalism.Something about our belief in the power of self-definition and starting over suggests to us that if we only sweep our floors, we will magically become new people, unburdened by the past. We like to think that we can do without, rough it to prove that we’re not so soft or bound to the past. Our collective impulse to KonMari our closets is merely the most recent in a long history of nationwide cleaning fugues, from Henry David Thoreau’s cabin to the present.In 1933, the American philosopher Richard Gregg published an essay called “The Value of Voluntary Simplicity” that foretold today’s preoccupations with decluttering, unplugging, and slowing down. “We think that our machinery and technology will save us time and give us more leisure,” he wrote, “but really they make life more crowded and hurried. It is time to call a halt on endless gadgeteering.” Gregg was critiquing telephones and Henry Ford’s motorcars, but also the greed of traders in the newly ascendant stock market that had helped cause the Great Depression.The solution to this hurried life, Gregg proposed, was an ethos of “voluntary simplicity:” a “singleness of purpose, sincerity and honesty within, as well as avoidance of exterior clutter, of many possessions irrelevant to the chief purpose of life.” Voluntary simplicity emphasized “psychic goods” — art appreciation, friendship, and love, for example — over owning things. It was the 1930s answer to “buy experiences, not things.”Gregg saw voluntary simplicity as a new aesthetic system, in line with what was happening in European modernist architecture at the time. He also cited the experience of visiting a Japanese country inn that sought an overall harmony through soft colors and textures, as opposed to a western excess of furniture or interior decoration. It taught him, “There can be beauty in complexity, but complexity is not the essence of beauty.” Like Thoreau, Gregg argued that the simplicity he advocated could be found in non-Western sources: The Indian Brahman class already lived in enlightened austerity, he said, as did the “leaders of China” (an assertion that might have come as a surprise to Chinese peasants).Gregg argued that choosing simplicity could provide a kind of “psychological hygiene.” He also thought that simplicity might be a way to solve poverty, because if the privileged decided to live with less as a choice, then the poor would feel better about their own “enforced simplicity,” ridding them of their sense of inferiority and, implicitly, the compensatory impulse to buy things. This is, of course, an ineffective solution to a much deeper structural problem. And yet, we often hear a version of the same narrative today: If only the poor would spend less money, then they wouldn’t be so poor.Gregg’s essay was influential, but it took a while to become mainstream. Four decades later, in 1977, the trend forecaster and public intellectual Duane Elgin revived the concept of “voluntary simplicity” in a report of the same name, written with the social scientist and consumer futurist Arnold Mitchell. He later turned the report into a bestselling book called Voluntary Simplicity: Toward A Way of Life That Is Outwardly Simple, Inwardly Rich. It was the 1970s equivalent of Marie Kondo and has been reissued multiple times, most recently in 2010.In his years working with a government commission on population growth and then for the Stanford Research Institute, Elgin observed a trend of Americans “returning to the simple life,” which the media had turned into a new archetype. Moving to the country, baking your own bread, and establishing cooperative businesses constituted a new social philosophy, he pointed out.Elgin’s version of voluntary simplicity was driven by a sense of disconnection: Economic and political structures had grown beyond human scale, so people wanted to separate themselves from them. He linked this attitude to a kind of nationalism that he saw as positive, writing that the desire for simplicity is “reminiscent of the stubborn independence out of which was born the American Revolution.” Getting rid of stuff wasn’t only good; it was patriotic.The “sense of urgency” to simplify that Elgin documented was intensified by a familiar kind of global havoc happening at the time: the threat of chronic energy shortage, the growth of terrorism, the possibility that even before we run out of resources “we may poison ourselves to death with environmental contaminants,” and “a growing social malaise and purposelessness.” Though Elgin assigns a problematic amount of blame to the “growing demands” of “less-developed nations,” we’re still concerned with the same issues now, decades later.Elgin even predicted the social media era’s obsession with curated authenticity, the kind that we see displayed on Instagram accounts: “each person will consider whether his or her level and pattern of consumption fits, with grace and integrity, into the practical art of daily living.”As I write this, I’m sitting in the lobby of a new hotel that used to be an enormous church. Now, under the barrel-vaulted ceiling is a café counter opening onto a vaguely bohemian hang-out full of slow breakfast meetings and office-less freelancers stationed with their laptops. The old stained-glass windows have been replaced with clear panels and the pews with low, plush blue-velvet couches and black hexagonal side tables arranged in repeating configurations, as if it were the chill-out room of a disco.Online and in print, journalists have described the style of this hotel as “minimalist,” and I’m sure many visitors would agree. It has a certain aggressive cleanliness. The historical remains of the church have been erased by painting the walls pale-blue and the ceilings white. The space has been divided by glass walls and illuminated by orbs mounted on squares of brass. The ceiling is high and airy, left open above a mezzanine, the expanse only broken by a hanging geometric sculpture made out of what used to be organ pipes.The design draws attention to scale and emptiness, the volume more than the content of the architecture. The building’s religious legacy is only hinted at, as if an amusing joke. Its interior has been covered with the same deceptively simple design that can be found in coffee shops, coworking spaces, retail boutiques, and rooms on Airbnb. In order to succeed, all of these types of places need to make multiple groups of people feel comfortable. Minimalism is a perfect fit because it allows for just enough character to make a space interesting but not too much. The rest gets smoothed over into blankness.The hotel design is a cultural detective story. How did an unlikely avant-garde phenomenon become the generic luxury style of the 2010s, both an aesthetic commodity and an ascetic philosophy at the same time? It seems like a paradox, but the trend is undeniable: Google’s index of published books shows a fivefold increase in the use of “minimalism” between 1960 and 2008, moving from near-zero to mainstream. Google searches for the term also hit the tip of a massive spike at the beginning of January 2017, the digital archeological mark of the cleaning binge.The moment that I knew minimalism was truly inescapable was while catching a train in New York City’s Penn Station. A woman walked toward me wearing a black-and-white striped shirt with “minimalism” written on the chest in glittering letters like a Louis Vuitton or Supreme logo would be, as if the word meant nothing at all — which maybe it didn’t. For a while, I figured I had hallucinated the shirt, but then I discovered online that it was sold by the Gap.Omnipresence usually means a loss of specificity. There are over 13 million posts tagged with #minimalism on Instagram and around 10 new images appear every minute. Millions more are uploaded on Pinterest, where users collect inspiration for redecorating their homes or rethinking their wardrobes. Shots of the blue sky pockmarked with clouds are categorized as minimalist, as are line-drawing tattoos, wrinkled bedsheets, folded clothing, Chemex coffeemakers, spiral staircases, monochrome athleisure outfits, rustic cabins in the snow, and demure selfies.An archive of material suggests that minimalism entails a lack of patterns, blocks of solid color, organic textures, and desaturated hues. Minimalist imagery has only a few discrete subjects or focal points. The style seems adapted for the internet and social media, where every image must either compete with or match the vacuum of white website backgrounds. It looks good on the screens that contain so much of our visual experience because the abundance of blank space makes otherwise subtle qualities stand out.The veneer of minimalism becomes like an organic food label, expensive green juice, or a high-end skin treatment replacing cosmetics: It’s another class-dependent way of feeling better about yourself by buying a product. It takes a lot of money to look this simple.Ultimately, the expansion and devaluing of minimalism happened because the concept has political roots, not just aesthetic. My theory is that minimalism seems to follow social crisis, as it has in the years following the financial crash of 2008. Like Gregg and the Great Depression, Duane Elgin’s theories fit the context of the 1970s, after the social upheaval of the late 1960s had ended and the Vietnam war had come to an unjustifiable end, ejecting scarred veterans.What Gregg and Elgin critiqued — and what minimalist bloggers struggle with, though they don’t mention it by name — is the state of capitalism itself. Consumerism causes a kind of alienation, in the Marxist sense: When workers are separated from the products of their labor and compensated by an hourly wage, they can’t find satisfaction in their jobs or the remainder of family life. Thus, they turn to accumulating capital as the only form of self-fulfillment. We work only to accumulate stuff and in turn the accumulated stuff dominates us, further distancing us from noncommodified things like joy and community. Labor “is therefore not the satisfaction of a need, but only a means for satisfying needs external to it,” Karl Marx wrote in 1844.“The less you are, the less you express your own life, the more you have, the greater is your alienated life, the greater is the store of your estranged being,” Marx argued. Stuff is therefore the enemy of happiness, but not just because it’s crowding your apartment.Written by"
30,Meet the Seniors Who Do CrossFit,"For more information on the novel coronavirus and Covid-19, visit cdc.gov.“I think you can handle this,” says Karima Adi, holding out a 20-pound dumbbell. The weight is thankfully not for me — I’m still using a six-pound kettlebell — but for my workout buddy Bill Cox, a 70-year-old retiree living in London. We’re at CrossFit Shapesmiths in Clapham, where I’ve been invited to join the CrossFit Masters class for people over 60. Adi, a certified CrossFit trainer and the driving force behind the Masters class, assures me we won’t be doing any of the handstand pushups I saw people completing on my way in — at least not yet.As Bill Cox and I make our way around our parallel workouts, doing snatches, push-ups, and ring-pulls, Adi explains that the movements are similar to daily life activities: bending down to pick something off the floor, taking things off high shelves, and pulling yourself out of bed. “This is about functional movement,” she says. “My aim is to help people maintain, or restore, their natural movement,” she says. “You have to sit down and stand up for the rest of your life, and you want to make sure that you never struggle in that.”Cox, a tall man with salt and pepper hair and glasses, has been doing CrossFit for three months and he’s already advancing to lifting heavier dumbells. Like the other seniors in his Masters class, he’s here to keep his body moving so that he can live independently into old age. For Cox, CrossFit is foremost about managing the symptoms of his Parkinson’s Disease. “It’s very important to me to keep my strength up,” he says, his voicing occasionally slipping into a slight stammer due to his condition. “The physiotherapists at the hospital said I couldn’t hope to get stronger, only slow the rate that I got weaker. But that’s proven to be untrue.”Cox says he was initially apprehensive about joining CrossFit when he saw all the people lifting massive weights. But he says the group does the same exercises with smaller, more approachable weights and fewer repetitions. “That’s attractive to me, and then it builds up from where you start,” he says. “I got hooked.”“Aging is inevitable, but loss of movement, faculties, balance, agility, coordination, power and strength, is not”Despite CrossFit’s reputation as being a hardass workout regime, its focus on functional movement makes it an ideal workout for people entering their advancing years. The Masters class launched by Adi follows the usual CrossFit style workout of heavy weights and multiple rounds of exercises, but the moves are a little slower and with a bit more adjustment to allow people to go at their own pace to avoid injury. (CrossFit gyms around the world provide different offerings, and people looking for senior-focused classes should call their local gym.)“Aging is inevitable, but loss of movement, faculties, balance, agility, coordination, power and strength, is not,” says Adi.The average human lifespan has expanded, with people in developed nations routinely living into their eighties. But research shows that these longer lifespans are not necessarily accompanied by good health. Often the years at the end of a person’s life are spent in disability, or with various health conditions like cancer or heart disease. Scientists debate the ways to limit the time spent in poor health at the end of life, but one thing is clear: If you don’t use your body, it will decline.“You need to give your body signals that you need the muscle, and then that signals to the immune system to keep healthy,” says Dr. Jenna Macciochi, an immunologist based in Brighton, U.K. “Muscle building is so much more than just making you strong. It’s producing hormones and molecules that are involved in regulating many processes in the body.”Elaine Heighington, a 68-year-old retiree living in London with early stage osteoporosis, is hoping the Masters class will help quell her symptoms. Heighington was first introduced to CrossFit by her daughter over two years ago. A cheerful blonde in workout leggings, Heighington found that the combination of strength and cardio was enough variety to keep her interested. “I get bored easily,” she says.Heighington considers CrossFit her alternative to the medication her doctor initially suggested. “I did my own research and found a study that showed you can reverse osteoporosis by lifting,” says Heighington, who is watching her 92-year-old mother become increasingly frail due to the same condition. “I decided that before I take medication, I want to try this route.”Dr. Andrea Klemes, an endocrinologist and Chief Medical Officer at MDVIP, a network of primary care physicians across the United States, confirms that weight training has been shown to be helpful for building bone density in people with osteoporosis, due to the fact that putting stress on bones can spur bone-forming cells into action. “If you’re exercising, you may be able to help protect your body from a fracture if you do fall, because your muscles are stronger,” she says.Exercise can also help prevent other debilitating health conditions, like heart disease, by lowering heart attack risk factors like inflammation and cholesterol, as well as keeping blood sugar stable. Aerobic exercise may help alleviate depression, and it also boosts the size of the hippocampus, a part of the brain vital for memory and learning. All of this should be taken with the caveat that seniors and people with illnesses should always consult a doctor to ensure their workout plans are suitable.“I almost never prescribe medicine if I can get somebody to do the work,” says Dr. Jessalynn Adam, a sports medicine and rehabilitation specialist in Baltimore, Maryland who says she has patients who have been able to substantially improve their health through working out. “High cholesterol, diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, heart disease — there are fewer side effects with exercise.”Despite its benefits, only 23% of Americans get enough exercise, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Lee Steggles, the co-owner of CrossFit Shapesmiths, calls the location “a social club disguised as a gym,” which he says is Shapesmiths’ strategy for getting people hooked.The workout spaces are open to the street, and anyone who walks past can peer in and watch people lift heavy weights and flip tires. Steggles says if you look past the handstand crowd in the front, you’ll see there are plenty of people of all shapes, sizes, and ages. The youngest member of the gym is eight and the oldest is 84 — the seniors quota is small but growing.If people can remain motivated enough to keep up the routine — whether it be CrossFit or simply a daily walk — the payoff is worthwhile, even if they start when they’re older. Adam, the sports medicine doctor, says anyone can make a “pretty big impact” on all the main physiological changes of age — these being muscle loss, water loss, and cardiovascular capacity. “I don’t think there’s ever a point where it’s too late to start exercising,” she says.Richard Dean, another co-owner of CrossFit Shapesmiths, can speak to the “it’s never too late” ethos from a personal level. Dean says he used to have a very unhealthy lifestyle until his mid-40s: “I smoked 25 [cigarettes] a day, liked to drink, ate terribly, did no exercise.” A tall guy with a shaved head, Dean is now 51, not that you can tell. For him, managing to quit smoking was the trigger to embrace a healthier approach to other aspects of his life. “I have an addictive personality, so when I kicked the smoking habit I wondered, what else I can do? I’d broken the barrier of being able to defeat something.” Dean says he knows there will come a day when he won’t be able to keep lifting increasingly heavier weights. “But the human psyche is a strange thing,” he says. “You are what you think you are.”Adi, the Masters coach, says she works on helping people create a state of mind of resilience. “Being out of breath is a bubble of discomfort,” she says. “But [when you exercise regularly] you become comfortable being uncomfortable. It teaches you how to withstand discomfort and still function. That’s a huge thing.”After our workout together ended, Cox headed out to France to spend a few weeks at his vacation house. He was bringing along some weights so he can keep up with his strength training over the summer. “One of my aims this year is to do a pushup on the floor,” he said. A few weeks later Adi showed me a photo that Cox had sent her of him carrying a large plank of wood in his garden, with a caption that read “heavy lifting,” and thanked CrossFit. A push-up on the floor may be a milestone, but being able to lift and carry heavy things around in everyday life is what really matters.Written by"
31,Pump You Up: The Enduring Power of Protein Powder,"For more information on the novel coronavirus and Covid-19, visit cdc.gov.My friend David recently hopped on the protein-powder express. Everyone I know seems to be downing the stuff, but I never thought David would join them. He’s a world-class food photographer, a Brooklyn boulevardier, a brilliant cook. He’s also Mr. Natural. David shops at farmers’ markets, drinks biodynamic wine, eats with the seasons. He forages. But the last time I saw him, he confessed that Gold Standard whey protein is his new culinary bestie.Why? David was on a mission to get ripped, and that involved intense lifting every day, and that meant his body was chewing up calories like Quadzilla. If he was going to build serious muscle, his trainer told him, he needed to eat 200 grams of protein a day.That’s a ton of protein. The recommended daily amounts are 46 grams for women and 56 for men. In food terms, that equates to eating four large chicken breasts a day, which David actually did for a while, but he found it dull to spend that much time eating. More often than not, he’d reach the end of the day well short of his 200 grams — and a couple of scoops of Gold Standard 100% Whey (24g of protein per scoop), blitzed with bananas and berries, got him over the line.I’ve written about food for 20 years, and I stay on top of nutritional science. I’ve eaten semi-paleo for years and I’m pleased with the beefcake-lite results, but I’ve always relegated powdered protein to the realm of health scams. I favor writer Michael Pollan’s rule about not eating anything your grandmother wouldn’t recognize. (Then again, my grandmother made it through the 1960s and 1970s on little more than cigarettes and Bugles.)But it’s become obvious that protein powder is no longer a trend reserved for muscle boys. It’s a $30 billion industry. It’s being pounded by Instagram influencers, teenage athletes, and aspirational octogenarians. It beckons from coolers of ready-to-drink shakes in every Walmart, Costco, and Whole Foods. What is so appealing about consuming daily dollops of beige powder?Most obviously, it’s about getting fit, which is often really about not getting fat. And since Americans have been taught that high-fat or high-carb diets cause weight gain, that leaves protein as the only macro left to eat. And technically it works. Unquestionably, protein leads to general buffness in a way that carbs and fat do not. But taking that logic to the extreme gets messy. Eating highly processed powder that bears no resemblance to food (not even Bugles) has to be bad for you, right?Proteins are biology’s masterpieces — incredibly complex molecules that can do highly diverse tasks. In a sense, they are life: All the actions that living things take, from moving and thinking to digesting and detoxifying, are done with proteins.Consider your genes. You have about 21,000. Each one carries the genetic blueprint for making a single protein. Every moment, your cells are following the code in your genes and stringing together nutrients from your food supply to build new proteins. Amino acids are the Lego blocks from which proteins are made. There are 20 different amino acids and a typical protein is a twisting chain of thousands of them, coiling around itself, which gives it a unique shape, chemistry, and function. Some proteins form muscle fibers that contract, some snip food into pieces in your stomach, and some detect invaders.But ultimately, as my friend David tells me, the quest for fitness isn’t about living longer, it’s about living more intensely, being able to crush life like a banana cream shake.Every day, your body breaks apart the protein you eat into amino acids and sends those to your cells to be reconstructed into new proteins. There’s no way to store amino acids, so you need a new supply every day. For this reason, the body has a particular hunger for protein that can’t be satisfied with potato chips or cookies. Making sure meals contain protein can help control overeating. Because protein molecules are complex and hard to break down, they keep you satiated for longer and take more energy to digest. Compared to an equivalent amount of carbs or fat, protein will provide fewer excess calories to be stored as body fat.In the developed world, most people get more than enough protein to meet their modest fitness needs. The typical American woman consumes 70 grams of protein a day without really trying, while the typical man eats 102. But serious athletes and bodybuilders need about one gram of protein per pound of body weight. They can benefit from a big pipeline of protein in a convenient form — like a powder. This is not news to the gym community. In fact, they’ve been way ahead of the trend for decades.The first popularized protein powder was created by a man named Irvin Johnson, who ran a gym in Chicago. In 1950, he published an article in Iron Man, one of the leading musclehead magazines of the era, titled “Build Bigger Biceps Faster with Food Supplements.” This flew in the face of the weightlifting wisdom of the day, which held that a normal, balanced diet provided all the nutrients necessary for a well-sculpted body.Over several articles in the next year, Johnson made his case for protein supplementation in Iron Man. “Are you interested in building bulging muscles, muscles with superb muscular tone, muscles rippling with strength?” he wrote. “Of course you are or you wouldn’t be reading this magazine. Let me pass on to you one of the great secrets I learned sometime ago about muscle building, one that has proven so very successful in my work here at the Irvin Johnson Gymnasium.”Johnson goes on to accurately explain why protein is the only macronutrient that can build new muscle. His understanding of physiology was well ahead of his time, yet he was also a classic huckster. “Here at the Irvin Johnson Gym,” he wrote, “where records in muscle building are being made at all times… we are always experimenting with foods and supplements to find out which are the best to include in the muscle building diet. We have made up our own food, which is called, ‘Irvin Johnson’s Hi-Protein Food’. We have been using this new food for several months and the results have been wonderful.”Some of the miraculous transformations described in the magazine defy belief. One young man reportedly arrived at Johnson’s gym weighing 169 pounds with 14.5-inch biceps. After a single day on Johnson’s formula, he jumped to 181 pounds with a 16.75-inch bicep. All according to Johnson.Johnson Hi-Protein Food, which was soy-based, cost $4 for a four-pound bag, and buyers could choose from plain, vanilla, chocolate, coconut, or, inexplicably, black walnut. Johnson sold his powder exclusively through the York Barbell Company, whose founder, Bob Hoffman, was the godfather of midcentury American fitness. Hoffman published Strength & Health, the top fitness magazine of the time, and he was the coach of the American Olympic weightlifting team from 1936 to 1968.In 1952, Strength & Health suddenly stopped advertising Johnson’s Hi-Protein Food and switched to Hoffman’s Special Hi-Proteen — available in plain, vanilla, chocolate, coconut, or black walnut. From then on, the York Barbell Company filled all orders with Hoffman’s powder, and Johnson was left in limbo. Hoffman’s Special Hi-Proteen had mixed success — it was notorious for the gas it produced in its enthusiasts — but Hoffman continued to introduce new nutritional supplements, accompanied by flamboyant testimonials, and he made a fortune (despite having dozens of products seized by the FDA for misleading health claims).Johnson, meanwhile, wasn’t done. After laying low for a while, he changed his name to Rheo H. Blair and reemerged in Los Angeles in the 1960s as a nutrition guru to the stars, working with such he-men as Charlton Heston and Lawrence Welk. His recipe transformed, too. Instead of soy, Blair’s Instant Protein was based on dried milk and eggs, making it the forerunner of today’s formulations.Do not underestimate how gross those early protein powders must have been. They were dried using heat, rollers, and other equipment that oxidized them. No one knew how to make the powders soluble, so they were gritty and bitter. That began to change in the 1970s and 1980s with the introduction of sophisticated membranes that could separate most solids from a liquid at room temperature. Today, using ultrafiltration membranes, spray-drying, and other technologies, it’s possible to concentrate proteins into soluble powders while preserving their integrity.The options for cheap sources of protein have been, and remain, eggs, milk, and soy (with peas and hemp seed recently joining the pack). If you’re vegan, soy, pea, or hemp are your main options, and they all work just fine. (Ignore what you hear about incomplete proteins that lack certain amino acids; if you are eating a variety of foods, you aren’t going to have any amino deficiencies.)Today the most popular source of protein supplement is whey, the byproduct of cheese making. To make cheese, milk is separated into solids (curds) and liquid (whey). The curds get turned into cheese, but for every one pound of cheese, there are nine pounds of whey to deal with. Today, many cheese operations could more accurately be described as whey-protein businesses with a little cheese making on the side. The top brand of whey protein, Gold Standard, was bought in 2008 by Glanbia, a giant Irish cheese maker looking to solve its whey problem.If the goal is to get semi-ripped, then whey powder can be a godsend for all the reasons it appealed to my friend David. It’s the easiest, cheapest way to add a lot of protein without too many carbs and fat, and the amino acids in whey are exactly what your muscles are looking for.But are any of these powders (soy, pea, hemp, or whey) healthy?Lots of folks have tried to pin health scares on protein powder, with limited success. High-protein diets have been accused of being hard on the kidneys, which have to process all those aminos, though this doesn’t seem to be a problem for people with healthy kidneys. A bigger concern is that people who pound protein might not get enough other micronutrients, which are mostly found in carb-rich fruits and vegetables.But the biggest issue with protein powders is what else might be in them. Like all dietary supplements, they receive no governmental safety testing. It’s up to the companies to conduct their own testing, and based on what third parties have found, some aren’t doing a very good job. Heavy-metal contamination is commonplace. In 2018, the Clean Label Project analyzed 134 of the top protein powder products. Seventy percent tested positive for lead, 74% for cadmium, and 55% for BPA, a known carcinogen and hormone disruptor. Worth noting: Organic products had twice the heavy metals (but lower levels of BPA) compared to nonorganic, and plant-based products were the most contaminated, while egg-based products were the least. Some products (Puori vanilla, Biochem vanilla, Body Fortress vanilla) tested low for all metals, but there wasn’t much consistency among the products of a particular brand.There are other concerns, too. Some researchers have found links between high-protein diets and diabetes or heart disease, though more research is needed. High-protein intake also stimulates cell proliferation, which is great if you’re trying to make more muscle cells, but not so great if you’re trying to prevent cancer or cell aging. Serious bodybuilders have a disturbing habit of dying young. High-protein eaters may burn twice as bright, but half as long.But ultimately, as my friend David tells me, the quest for fitness isn’t about living longer, it’s about living more intensely, being able to crush life like a banana cream shake. I thought about that this morning as I stared at a scoop of protein powder on my kitchen counter. It was biology’s masterpiece, sitting there in a kind of suspended animation. How could I resist the opportunity to raise it from the dead, to transform it into even more living, breathing, flexing, pumping me?Written by"
32,Paper Planes,"It all started with a simple, whimsical idea.Paper planes and high places.“Adam, are you doing anything this afternoon?”“Well, I’m at the office right now,” he said.“Do you still work at that big building in Akasaka?”“Uh, yeah. Why?”“You think we could get to the roof? Sneak out for an hour?”He considered it.“Yes,” he said. “I think we could do that.”I bought some A4 paper from a local stationery shop. A calming emerald green. Just beautiful. I hefted it to Adam’s office building in Akasaka.He met me at reception.“Delivery,” he said.The receptionist nodded and gave me a visitor’s pass. We jumped in an elevator.I looked out at the buildings and the traffic.“You think there’s a girl out there for me?” I asked.“Out where?”“You know, out there.”I took my time. Folding. Creasing. Getting it just right.“Maybe. Probably. Statistically? Definitely.”“Hm.”Adam let a plane go. Watched it a moment. Smiled.“Man, this feels good,” he said. “We should do this more often.”So we did.We wandered the city. Listed potential spots. Drew maps.We wore suits at some places. Looked like deliverymen at others. Turns out if you look like you’re supposed to be there, and ask for Suzuki — there’s always one — reception will usually let you straight up.We threw planes from office buildings. Apartment blocks. Old factories. University libraries. Each offered something unique to its location.Most of the big buildings — the dream spots — we couldn’t get into. Mori Tower, Toranomon Hills, the Metropolitan Government Building. Tokyo Tower. Security was tight. It seemed impossible.We still tried.Some days we set off fire alarms.“I mean, you would think there is someone out there, right? For me, I mean.”“Statistically, yes.”Adam watched another plane fly from his hand. Nodded.“You and those statistics.”“Well, it helps put things in perspective, you know? It’s how I make sense of the world.”“What are you writing?”The paper said: Let’s be lonely together.And underneath that, a phone number.“Wait,” I said. “Is that my phone number?”“It’s an experiment.”“What?”“Like, a statistics experiment.”He folded the paper and threw the plane. We watched it float, and dive, and spin through the air.“That’s thirty,” he said. “So I guess now we just see what happens.”I groaned. Adam laughed.And then we went home.At first, there was nothing.Then one day, a phone call.It was a salaryman. Kohei. He said the paper was stuck in his bicycle. He liked the color of it. So calming.He said he didn’t know why he called.“Let’s talk,” I said.Kohei talked about his life. About working for a small game development company, playing pachinko, reading shojo manga. He said he missed his wife and kids. Said they were long gone now. Weren’t coming back.I asked how old they were. What he thought they might be doing. What it was like having kids. I asked about his favorite characters in his favorite manga. Where the appeal was in pachinko. How to play.He talked, and he talked, and eventually, he stopped.He said he felt much better.Funnily enough, so did I.“So yesterday I went to Glitch, finally,” I said. “You were right. The coffee is good. Excellent.”“Yeah, wait. What’s with the paper?”“What do you mean?”I took a piece, folded it, and stared at the city before me. Where to throw first?“I mean, what’s with the times? ‘Unavailable from 8:00 to 13:00’?”I’d scribbled it underneath my phone number.“Well, I have to work, you know? If I can’t work, I can’t eat. I need some space between the phone calls to actually get work done, yeah?”I waited for it. That point where the wind felt just right. A little lift, a little push. I let the paper plane go, and watched it twist and turn above the buildings. How lazy. How free. The first one was always my favorite.“Wait,” Adam said. “You mean people are actually calling you?”All sorts of people called.Stressed office workers, students on break, bored housewives, part-timers in search of dreams — they were all lonely, and we shared that. Gave it warmth. Made it ours. They spoke, and I listened. An unspoken agreement. Comfortable. Calming.Some six or seven people called in the afternoon. In the evening, four or five. After that, I turned the phone off.And then I met Yuki.“I found your flyer,” she said.“Thanks for calling.”“I like the color. So calming.”“It’s wonderful, isn’t it?”“I’m Yuki.”“Hello, Yuki.”“Can we talk?”“We can.”“Does it take long?”“Uh, sometimes? It depends on the person.”“So what do we talk about?”“Well, whatever you want, really. What do you feel like talking about, Yuki?”Yuki was the first person to do something no one else had.She was the first to ask me about me.“The police called?”I nodded.“Yeah, they wanted to know about the papers,” I said.“What did you say?”“I said I didn’t know. I said it was the first I’d heard about it.”“Did they believe you?”“No. They said if it was me, I should at least make the paper biodegradable. It wouldn’t be a cleanup issue that way.”“And you said?”“I said as soon as I could source good, quality biodegradable paper that flew well and looked nice, I’d do it.”Adam laughed.“Busted.”I smiled. Shrugged. We threw another two planes from the roof.“Doesn’t matter,” I said. “That officer sometimes calls on Thursday nights when work slows down. Tetsu is his name. Good guy. Diligent, kind. He was just offering advice.”Yuki called once a week. Every Tuesday, 19:30. She asked about my day, my writing, my calls. I shared funny stories from work, and ideas I had floating around in my head.I could hear her smile through the phone. Repressed excitement in her voice. She chased my ideas like a puppy with a tennis ball — unsure exactly what to do with them but enraptured all the same.And little by little, she opened up. She had a pet cat, Mr. Mittens. Lived in a tiny apartment along the Inokashira Line. Worked a boring customer service job. Liked to draw. Loved it. Sketched a picture a day. Mostly of people. Sometimes Mr. Mittens. Sometimes a landscape.I asked her to show me some. She said she couldn’t. Had never. Could never. I said she should. I said please.No no no, she said, giggling.It was something like flirting.And in the flirting and the talking, was something like friendship. Something like romance.Perhaps something like love.Adam looked up from his half-folded plane.“A TV station called? Seriously?”“Yeah, a morning program,” I said. “I forget the name. They wanted an interview. I said we could talk on the phone, but they wanted in-person.”“You won’t do in-person?”I shook my head.“I think it would spoil what I have with the people I talk to.”I had this idea that on the phone, I was malleable. Without shape. Each caller imagined me a particular way — a way that made them comfortable. To see me in person, I thought, would cause a clash of reality and imagination.In that clash, reality always wins. I didn’t want it to.“But TV, man,” Adam said.“Yeah, I know.”“You don’t ever want to meet them? The people you talk to?”“I don’t know that they ever want to meet me, if I’m honest. I’m quite happy with things as they are. There’s a simple status quo, and I don’t feel lonely.”“Fair enough.”We threw some more planes. Made jokes about Bob Ross. Impersonations as they pertained to plane throwing. Laughed. We talked video games and design, and I thought about the loneliness I felt. The way it was changing over time.A gradual slide, like blue to green, from loneliness to longing.And I wondered which I preferred.“They asked you on TV?”“Yeah,” I said. “Can you believe it?”There was a moment of silence. Deep thoughts swam in it.“Yes,” Yuki said simply.I laughed.“What? You seem like a nice guy. Maybe people want to know you.”“I listen to people talk. If it helps, great. I’m happy. But I don’t need to go on TV. If I do, or if I meet people, I’ll spoil the illusion.”“There’s an illusion?”“Well, no. Probably not. It’s just me.”“You’re the illusion?”“No, I’m the spoiler.”She laughed.“You won’t meet anyone?” she asked.“Not if I can help it.”“Never?”“Well, never say never, right?”“Would you ever meet me?”I paused for a moment.“I… would that be okay?”“Is it okay with you?”“It’s okay with me if it’s okay with you.”“It’s okay with me.”“And me, too.”We shared the silence. A space that felt like it was closing in.“Should we just… should we meet, then?” she asked.Teenagers, all over again.“Would you… would you bring one of your pictures?”I sat at the cafe. Waited.I waited for an hour. Then two.I waited for a long time.Inside, couples, families, and friends sat and talked. The air buzzed with conversation. Laughter. Joy. Staff members prepared coffee. Poured it with a smile.Outside, traffic rolled by. Cars. Motorbikes. Scooters.Pedestrians.Any one of them could have been her. Any one of them could have been Yuki.But none of them was.I didn’t hear from her that week.Life went on. The world kept spinning.People called, and we talked, and there was a feeling like relief and fleeting joy.Yuki didn’t call the next week, either. Or the next.It was something like a gradual slide, like green to blue, from longing back to loneliness.I didn’t need to wonder which one I preferred.I knew.“So you’re plane throwing without me now?”“What?”Adam passed over a piece of paper.“This,” he said. “Is this you?”It was a cat. A pencil sketch of a tabby, sitting on the edge of a desk. Pens sprawled across its surface. Sunlight streaming in from an open window.The paper was creased. I knew those folds.It was a plane, once.“This isn’t me,” I said.“Yeah, I thought so. I didn’t think you could draw.”I nodded.“Guess you’ve got yourself a copycat,” Adam said.“I guess so.”I stared at that cat for a long time. Listened to Adam whistle while he worked.“It’s nice to meet you, Mr. Mittens,” I said.“What?”I shook my head.“It’s nothing,” I said. “Where did you find this, anyway?”The next day I walked from Shibuya Station, toward Roppongi. I dropped in and out of back streets, picking up paper planes. Unfolding them, staring at the pictures, and putting them in my bag.Each of them contained a sketch — a landscape, a cat, a girl staring out the window, a boy drinking a coffee.I took them home, and I put them in a folder.And I stared at those pictures for a long time.Each Wednesday I found a new picture or two somewhere in Aoyama.I had enough to categorize my folders.Cats. People. Nature. Birds.And finally, a cityscape as drawn from upon high.I knew those buildings. Knew that space. Knew that sky.It was one of the dream spots. It was in Shibuya.“I need to get to the top of the Mixi building,” I said.“We tried that already. They kicked us out, remember?”“Yeah, but I have a hunch about something.”“A hunch about what?”“I can’t say.”“You can’t say.”I shook my head.“I can’t say.”I felt like she wanted me to find her.I just couldn’t say it.“Alright,” Adam said. He sighed. Nodded. “I’ll order a package delivery to an upper floor. It won’t be their’s so they’ll need someone to pick it up and return it. That’s your way in. You’ll have to look the part, and you won’t have much time, but that’s probably the best I can do.”“It has to be Tuesday,” I said.“What? Why?”I stared at him. Shook my head.“Okay, okay,” he said. “I get it. You can’t say.”We watched the skyline a moment longer.“Thanks,” I said.On Tuesday night, reception was empty.I looked around the empty foyer of the Mixi building. Outside at the traffic passing by in the night. Shrugged.I took the escalator to the second floor and an elevator to the roof.“How did you get up here?” Yuki asked.I shrugged.“It’s odd,” I said. “There’s uh… there’s no one at the reception desk. You?”She smiled. Blushed.“I’m the receptionist.”We stood there for a moment. She with a piece of paper in hand, me with my hands in my pockets.She looked like her voice — delicate, beautiful, and wrapped in timidity.“Your art,” I said, “I really like it.”“You always said I should share it.”“I’m glad you have.”She blushed again.“Bit cheeky, isn’t it?”I smiled. “I think it’s a great idea. But one thing, if I may?”“Oh?”“Will you let me teach you how to fold a sturdy paper plane?”We threw planes in silence for a time. Watched them twirl, dance, dive, and float.“This is nice,” she said.“It is,” I said. “It is.”“I… I didn’t think it would be.”“What did you think it would be?”“I don’t know. Something different. Something… bad.” She paused. “Something disappointing.”“Hm.”“Look,” she said, “I’m… I’m sorry I never called.”“You don’t have to be sorry,” I said. “It was never something to be sorry for.”“But…”I shook my head.“Let’s just throw some paper planes, yeah?”“Will you keep doing it?”“Hm?”“Answering calls,” Yuki said, “Talking to strangers about their lives.”I thought about it. Looked down at the plane I was folding.“I figure as long as people keep calling, I’ll keep listening,” I said. “It’s just… I don’t know. I feel like in this city, we’re all porcupines that can’t hug because we’re too scared of hurting each other. These calls are like long-distance hugs, I think. There’s space, but there’s warmth. It’s a unique kind of connection. A link between lost souls.”“Long-distance hugs,” she said. “I like that.”We stood in silence. Listened to the wind through the air and the traffic below. Life as it crept around corners.“I’m a porcupine, too,” she said finally.“Okay.”“Even long-distance hugs are hard for me.”I nodded.“And that’s okay, too.”And a gentle lightness in the air. Serenity.A smile.“Thank you.”Yuki watched a plane float through the sky. Looked at her watch.“Can we do this some more?” she asked. “Can we do this for a bit longer?”“As long as you like,” I said.It was a relationship like a paper plane in flight.Lost and aimless, rambling and free. We didn’t know where it might go, or where it might land — we were happy just to see it float, and fly, and ride on the wind.We were making a different kind of hug altogether.One for just the two of us.MusicWritten by"
33,"Meditations On Sucking At Relationships, Dating, And Not-Dating, Too, As It Happens","I have a date tonight is a thing I didn’t say much last calendar year, though at the time of this writing — a Thursday, one of the last of 2017— it happens to be true. Or it’s true for the time being (3:26 p.m. being the time being), which doesn’t necessarily mean it will be true later (later being tonight). I have a five-hour window during which some blessed derailment could occur: an apartment emergency or a sudden deadline or perhaps a seasonal stomach flu which, as it happens, never really go out of season.I used to be more comfortable making dates and then making stories as to why I could no longer make the dates, but now I try to avoid it. I made very few excuses in 2017, and even fewer commitments — which, it should be obvious, was key to my making fewer excuses. It turns out I didn’t need as many once I realized it was okay, perhaps even healthy, to experience a period of time in which my romantic/sexual desires do not inform my every thought and action. So much of my adult life has been colored by a relationship or shaded by the absence of one; always falling in love or growing into it, then falling or crashing out of it, and then a period of mourning, followed by a period of rebirth, Spiritual Spring, femininity more potent than at any time in human history, all dead things jerking back to life now — me included and especially.Usually at that point in the cycle I’d enter a new relationship that was aesthetically different from the last but functionally, not so much. All lessons learned forgotten, if I like how you smell in the morning. Does it not always come down to that? I can buy you a book, Google you a therapist, measure your inseam and talk to the shop girl on your behalf but I can’t create your pheromones in my own image. Some things can be fixed, improved, overlooked, managed; but others — the invisible and magical things over which I have no control, the wild things — those are the things that choose me, not the other way around. Maybe this is why I don’t trust my instincts when it comes to dating apps: I know what I’m supposed to look for, what a healthy version of myself would want and accept. And then dude shows up for the date smelling all wrong. What’s a feral bitch to do?I have a couple common afflictions, one of them being codependency. Perhaps you’ve heard of it. It’s a type of dysfunctional relationship in which one or both (or all) participants are addicted: addicted to substances, addicted to helping, addicted to each other. A mother who drives her alcoholic son to the liquor store at 9 a.m. because he’s too smashed to get behind the wheel is codependent. Though she might know her actions will eventually kill her son, the alternative — losing his love and attention in the short term — is a worse fate. But while codependency was first identified and observed amongst the families and friends of alcoholics, sobriety does not equal immunity: One can also be addicted to love! sex! pretty much anything! And since codependency can take on many forms, it can be hard to recognize — especially when you’re one of its hostages, especially when most or all of your romantic relationships have been codependent to the extent that the bliss of being needed, or the bliss of being accommodated, is what signals (to you) that this is *for real*. Meanwhile, healthy relationships — those with boundaries, and clear communication, and accountability — seem cold, boring in comparison. Too much work! Not enough need! Where is the passion!If you are the type of person who needs to be needed — or the type of person who needs to enabled — you may be prone to codependent relationships. I was (am?), and so last summer I told my therapist that I was taking a break from dating while I learned to derive satisfaction from something other than making specific men believe that I am Good and Useful. She told me I could date and learn to do that at the same time. I told her that, in addition to being sure I would swaddle my independence and dump it on some church steps the second I felt a feeling again, the idea of dating exhausted me. Then she hit me with, “I’d be exhausted too, if I never felt safe enough to ask for what I wanted.”“It’s not like that,” I told her, unsure whether we were addressing a specific instance or a general pattern.She asked who takes care of me, then, which I won’t put into dialogue because I didn’t have a response. I wanted to say, “I take care of me,” but I don’t. Other people’s needs are more urgent, more interesting. Always have been.She continued, in the Here’s a concept sort of way that precedes all considered monologues, “What if your next partner took care of himself, and you took care of yourself, and with all of that out of the way, you’d both have more time to enjoy the relationship?”Honestly sounded like alien-talk to me. I paused to consider the couples in my life: Did people do this, come to the table whole? Had I witnessed this before without realizing it? And what would me and my Whole Boyfriend do with all that extra time in which we’re not feeding each other’s soul holes? Go on a cruise? Because truth told, given my birth rank in the American caste system, and my affinity for middling live entertainment and shrimp towers, and the way it feels to search for solid earth with my eyes and not find it, no land or escape for miles — knots? — what I’m trying to say is, if someone were going to love me, they would have to be the type of person who can appreciate the type of person who appreciates a cruise. Or the concept of one, at least.But when I’m discussing my wants with the therapist, I don’t mention cruises. I don’t mention that, when I imagine the person I want to spend a significant amount of my future time with, all I’ve sketched of the character so far is Fun At Weddings. I don’t explain that Fun At Weddings is code for: unashamed to be seen with me in emotional and formal settings; lets small children stand on the tops of his feet while he dances their fawn-like bodies around the room the way my dad used to with me; tolerates my own “Fun” Wedding Behavior, such as leading the reception in a medium-accurate rendition of the Grammy award-winning music video “Thriller” — just one of my many good-natured quirks that will become less endearing and more predictable throughout the years, perhaps unbearably so, though close friends have endured my “Fun” Wedding Behavior — and graver offenses — for decades so it’s not out of the realm of possibility; unafraid to make eye contact with 80-year-old women, dance with 80-year-old-women, tease 80-year-old women. Eighty years is just a placeholder for however long I end up living. Finally — and this is not required but is smiled upon — Giving Good Speech. Public speaking terrifies me and so whatever it is inside of someone that allows them to do it, and charmingly so… I don’t understand it, which means it falls under the umbrella of invisible and magical things — and you know how I feel about those.I don’t get into details with my therapist because. Because I’m not ready to translate these specific and condition-contingent wants into action items. Because I’m not clearheaded enough, at current, to discern between compromising and settling. Because knowing what I want also means knowing what I don’t want, except sometimes what I want and what I don’t want are the same thing; manufactured in the same factory, and isn’t cross-contamination a bitch? Because my wants are, and always have been, transient, rooted in how a person makes me feel or how I feel about a person but not in the person himself, which means the dissatisfaction of one or both parties is imminent. And of course, he’ll leave first — physically, emotionally, it depends on which narrative makes most sense — at which time I can point out that I was right to hold back, that I was aware of this destiny all along but allowed idealistic others to convince me different, and look what happened, I underline “again,” so of course none of this has to do with me and my shortcomings as a partner or as a person in general. Because if it did, I would have to do something about it. And.When it comes to love, is there a difference between wants and needs? Isn’t it all a want of some sort, given that you live without these so-called needs met when you’re single, or when you might as well be? Then again, I suppose those in functioning relationships upgrade their wants to needs—needs like respect and honesty and communication, which are not needs in the strict sense of the word but more like standards, boundaries, things I have struggled to define or even require — because “I can do bad all by myself,” to quote Tyler Perry for some reason.I would say that I consider most things that do not keep me alive “wants,” but that might suggest I consider them at all. For most of my life, defining my wants and needs fell out of my purview — it wasn’t an intentional thing, I just didn’t take the time to decide and so someone else always did. I’m like that person who can’t figure out where to eat lunch. Just like that.I learned at a young age that wanting things was a good way to get disappointed. Growing up, my mom was always quick to inform me that the thing I thought I needed was actually just a want, and an ill-formed one at that, because she had been around longer than I had, seen how these fads came and went. And also, someday I would realize this, but the things I thought I wanted? Too ugly to stand the test of time, which is why a fake and/or cheap version will suffice, and why did I want to turn myself into a walking billboard for Tommy Hilfiger, anyway? What did he ever do for me? And if Monica jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge wearing those powder blue patent leather Reeboks with the double Velcro straps…? WELL?So wanting never quite worked in my favor. I never went without the things I “needed,” school books, clean underwear (they might not have been the notebooks or underwear I’d have chosen for myself, but what are you gonna do). Needs were outlined and provided by adults: parent, teacher, politician. Wants were different: they were renting a VHS for the weekend or eating McDonald’s for dinner: fringe benefits, by no means expected or required to live.And so meeting, and falling in love, and sharing a life with another person is a) a want so large and difficult to fulfill — approximately 1000 times more difficult than getting McDonald’s for dinner — that subconsciously I’m not sure why I would win that particular lotto and b) enticing but ultimately unnecessary. Just to be logical about it. The promise of lifelong commitment is not something I need, clearly, because I don’t have it right now and here I am all alive, typing thousands and thousands of words about how much I don’t need this one particular thing that lots of other people have acquired, sort of effortlessly, or at least it seems so from here.One thing about me is the stuff I don’t need is the stuff I want most.Maybe all this bluster is meant to distract me, and you, from the fact that I still don’t know what I want or need from another person. I never took the time to tease that out because, plainly, I didn’t feel like being disappointed. Don’t want no shit, won’t get no shit. And that’s just fine! I still don’t have a driver’s license because I couldn’t afford a car when I turned sixteen; this doesn’t explain why I don’t drive now, fifteen years later, but it does illustrate how if you tell yourself you don’t need something enough times, it will eventually come to pass that you’re right.Terrifying.Most men I’ve dated knew — or thought they knew — what they needed, which was usually Not Me. The specifics were harder to articulate beyond that; they just knew something was amiss. And perhaps it was that confidence — that knowing of needs, even when used as a weapon against me — that I was attracted to. A confidence I both lack and admire, the irony, but as they say: opposites attract. Until they don’t. It’s not anyone’s fault. I mean, half these guys didn’t even know who they were dating, because I didn’t tell them. And you can’t expect people to need someone they don’t know exists; you can’t expect them to know you, when you don’t even know you. The ephemeral and conditional version of you — the one you offer up to protect the real and messy version of you — it might be agreeable, it might scratch a short-term itch, but is it Wifey? Because as it happens, you don’t have to be agreeable, or any nice and simple thing, to find love. In fact, I’m starting to believe all you need to be is convincing.I do not have a good record of convincing. I’ve always had a lot of feelings, currents of emotional energy, a hunger for physical touch, Gasoline as Blood; I’ve always needed a place to put these things. I needed a place more than I needed to be known, to be heard (it seemed that way, at least) and so in relationships I worked toward a desired outcome — to keep happy the person, who was also the place, (my receptacle), so that I might keep both — though my behavior was often in conflict with how I felt. That is, if I remembered I had feelings of my own — most times I skipped that part of the integration, which means many of my decisions, the things I said and even thought, did not reflect what I felt; rather I was guessing at what was “right.” And of course by “right” I mean, “what is the thing I can say that will make him love me like, for real.” I wanted to be loved for real because then, maybe (and yes, ironically, again), I would feel safe enough to be myself. Do you follow? I thought the only way to be myself was to first be someone else, as though one version of myself was simply a gateway drug to the truer, more accurate version.I confess: It’s a flawed strategy. One of the worst I’ve conceived. Because I had never, would never say, or do, the “right” thing in a relationship: the “right” thing is convincing, it has conviction. It has a point of view, and a point of origin; it has a point. Each time I remembered this — usually during some breakup negotiation, when it dawned on me that I had nothing to lose and could say whatever I wanted and it was going to feel so fucking good, finally — I was rewarded. I had expected that sharing my Real Feels would result in accusations of betrayal, or an equally shocking admission to punish me for my unapologetic cowardice and hypocrisy, which had no doubt quietly tainted the relationship — but instead I got dismay. Shock, in some cases. And active, unsolicited attention, which is — mind you, it’s been some years now so this is just a guess — probably all I wanted in the first place.You can see why these relationships — inadvertently made one-sided by both my eagerness to please and my misguided assumptions that pleasing required I remain unknown — failed to evolve.I’ve experienced most breakup configurations, dumped and been dumped and then there was one I *think* we both classify as mutual, though I took it harder and could have contorted my emotions a dozen-or-so more times before the thing ended for-real for real. Only once did I want and initiate a breakup — and while it was hand-to-god exhilarating, to be the one for whom singledom was inviting and not in any way a reflection of my own personal failings, I’m usually the other one. (In fact, even the guy I dumped had dumped me first, and second.) So the ends of things began to play out with a familiar cadence that would evoke in me all the classics: insecurity and foolishness, dumb-assery. I often felt used. But then what had I done, given my partners only what I believed they wanted while omitting the rest so that I might enjoy the trappings of intimacy without actually engaging in it? If he doesn’t know about the rest, I must have reasoned, he can only reject what I’ve decided to show him. So when he leaves, it won’t be a rejection of everything I am. Just some of it.Perhaps I’ve been used, but perhaps I’ve been a user. You know? Maybe I’m drawn to cursed relationships because when it comes down to it, I don’t want to feel safe yet. Because despite fancying myself a victim in the aftermath of a breakup, I’m not as safe as I purport to be. Because I’m not ready to be my whole self, or to be loved for it, or to work through the related implications, like: how do I cultivate enough trust in others, or enough confidence in myself, or enough whatever in whatever! to just… go about being who I am? How do I listen to my gut after allowing my brain to shout it down for so long? And knowing all of this — the deficiencies both listed and alluded to here, but also the others that are out of scope for this particular reflection — how can I waste even an hour of someone’s time knowing this is where I live?Sometimes a friend will share a problem with me and I’ll immediately want to advise them, provide them with options and comfort and empathy, but definitely sometimes just because it feels good, to not have that particular problem at that particular time. It also feels good to have figured out something that someone else hasn’t, of course, and sometimes you don’t realize you know a thing until someone else admits that they don’t — a realization that can become a little distracting, particularly if you haven’t had a win in a while. Possibly, you think, declaring the realization will allow you to recenter your friend’s problem, offer them a new angle to mull over, and what’s the harm? Or maybe you don’t think at all; maybe the advice is halfway out of your mouth before you realize it’s happening. Again.I had to be advised multiple times under these conditions before I realized I should aim to withhold advice until someone has asked for it. Sometimes people just want to vent. Sometimes they already know what they’re doing wrong, or what they’d like to change, and they’re just attempting to articulate the problem so that they can more clearly see the solution, but now they’re kinda sidetracked because they’re considering how your hypothetical advice may or may not figure into the actual experience they’re having, the original problem having officially been backburnered at this point, which. And it’s okay — I’m spelling this out precisely because my efforts to express empathy often manifest in me asserting authority over a situation I have not experienced, and I know most times advising someone who hasn’t asked to be is more a misguided gesture of goodwill than anything else. No judgments there.But it’s with this understanding — of the impulse to fix, advise — that I ask you to not, in this instance. Politely, I swear. Believe in intentional disclosure, particularly as I already have a track record of omitting things. Believe that for all the information you have from reading this far down, there is more, always more; there will be more in between the time I write these words and the time I publish them, and more after that. Believe that I have considered the following: that this particular piece of writing does little to make me appear more stable, generous, loving, confident, gracious, considerate, modest, kind, any number of qualities that might swing the balances in my favor; that I’m probably a nightmare to date; that I expect too much and too specifically; that I’m too old to be this confused; that given what I have on offer I can’t afford to be this old AND this confused; that this entire work is really just the mother of all sabotage and I am publishing it, consciously or not, as part of a self-fulfilling prophecy; that I get off on dissatisfaction; that I could find someone if I were less or more meh meh meh. You wouldn’t be wrong to accuse me of one, or all, or more of these things, but you would be wrong to think you are more of an authority on the ways in which I am wrong than I am.Though it is possible I’m so wrong, about everything, that I’m assuming some version of this screed is stashed in the heads of other terminally singles when it’s actually not. I suppose some of this disclosure is meant to test that theory — that I’m not the only one who thinks this way, that thinking this way doesn’t make me impossible to be with — it’s meant to reassure myself that I too can find love, even by being my overthinking and occasionally overwrought self, even with a brain intent on destroying anything resembling it. But if it so happens that I’m the only person on earth who is simultaneously a) aware that they are sabotaging themselves but b) in no rush to do anything practical about it, well. I think we can all agree that if this were the case, I would have far less time to wonder whether my hypothetical partner will treat cruises and weddings with the proper reverence. Which might not be a bad thing.But I digress. All I mean is that I both empathize with the desire to advise me and assert that there are too many details missing here — and from much of my writing, and even from my interactions with the people who know me best —to offer useful insight. If you’re very perceptive, you’ll note that what I’m doing here is creating a boundary, which we’ve earlier established is something I need to be proactive about, and maybe that’s enough to suggest to you, would-be advice-giver, that I am aware of some steps I could take to improve my situation — and occasionally, I’m even employing them.One last thing: I did not cancel the date I mentioned when I began writing this, two weeks ago. It was fine! It was a date. I call back to it now only because I loaded that particular gun, though I guess Chekhov would suggest a more explosive conclusion — it’s not much of a payoff. But sometimes people just want to vent! There’s a concept.Written by"
34,I Loved My Husband. I Loved Him So Much.,"People have all sorts of hidden talents; I am magic with a chicken. Golden brown, garlic-blistered, hissing herb-scented steam when you slice into it after 20 minutes of being driven mad by the smell. Waiting is the hardest part of the process, but like every worthwhile sensual pleasure, a great dinner responds gorgeously to delayed gratification.Chickens, like people, need time to rest after getting cooked.After work on Tuesdays, I would strip off my slim black pantsuit and slip into yoga pants and one of D’s sweatshirts. I’d mix fresh herbs with salt and olive oil, then massage the mixture underneath the skin of a small bird.Tuesdays were the only nights I had the apartment to myself — he taught an acting class from 7 to 10, his entire week whittled down to three hours of work.D had turned his back on quotidian concerns like paying rent, consumed by a feverish belief in the immediate inevitability of a big-time career. Hollywood producers beckoned from seaside patios in Malibu; Broadway people made offers no reasonable playwright could refuse. Those phone calls were not hallucinations. I heard them. I was taken along to steak dinners, bore witness to promises made, dreams hatched, famous names dropped like a breadcrumb trail out of obscurity.Everything was about to explode, so in the name of stability, I put my own creative work on hold and got a corporate job.One night around 11, a producer called and told him the deal was off. They were moving forward, of course, just without him. She made him promise not to kill himself, or her. Suddenly Tuesday night scene study was all he had left.“I love my husband. I love my husband so much.”I would catch myself chanting this as I trotted home to the top-floor apartment we never should have tried to afford. It was true, but since when does anything real bear so much repeating?This was a rough patch we’d tell our children about one day, when they were old enough to have torturous relationships of their own.Every night, I’d find him in his office chair in a cloud of smoke, heater on full blast. He’d be semi-catatonic, ruminating over his computer, or weeping hopelessly, or shouting about the crumbs I’d left in the sink before I’d gone to work.“Do it again, and I’ll leave you.”The year before, when his career possibilities reached their apex, D began serving up ultimatums about the clothing I wore (not revealing enough), the volume of my voice (too soft), the speed at which I walked (too slow or too fast, depending on the day). I had to solemnly swear to laugh at all his jokes, whether or not I found them funny. Because — and his therapist agreed on this — my refusal to laugh was evidence of a power struggle. The same shrink suggested he keep a running list of everything I did wrong. “If you saw it,” he warned, “you’d die.”But this was temporary. I loved my husband. I loved him so much. Marriage is no cakewalk: Anyone will tell you that. This was a rough patch we’d tell our children about one day, when they were old enough to have torturous relationships of their own.Later, D came to believe he’d gained psychic powers. He’d say a word and within seconds, someone would repeat it on television. He started having prophetic dreams, which he’d verify via Google. One night I had to beg him not to carry out a plot to poison the neighbor’s puppy, which had been barking for hours, keeping him from his writing.When you’re looking at the person you adore more than anything in the world, how can you force yourself to also see who’s actually standing right in front of you?Werewolf movies always have a scene where the afflicted person, still in human form, gets caught outdoors with their lover, just as night begins to fall. Once they catch a glimpse of that full moon, they realize what’s coming: They beg, then scream at their beloved to run away, to save themselves. But the lover thinks it’s a joke, or a flirtation, or even a poorly timed breakup. So they stand their ground, and laugh, or argue, or cry, or get indignant. But they never leave until it’s too late. Because when you’re looking at the person you adore more than anything in the world, how can you force yourself to also see who’s actually standing right in front of you?For seven years, we’d cheered each other on, shared everything, hatched a thousand plots to grow our careers, creative lives, and family. He was the first person to insist I drop everything and start writing, my fears and sense of inadequacy be damned. He loved me harder and believed in me more deeply than I’d ever had reason to dream about.And now he was behaving this way because he was suffering on a level I couldn’t fathom. His pain, we both understood, eclipsed anything he could have possibly inflicted back on me. And I understood this, too — between the rent I was shouldering, the storms I navigated us through, the near-constant falling out with friends, family, and colleagues — he could not survive without me.So I kept roasting those Tuesday night chickens. Because even this man, who had come to believe I was actively conspiring to ruin his life, couldn’t bite into one of those perfectly seasoned drumsticks and not taste unfaltering love. A wife’s love.He would recognize me, and return to himself, to both of us, because where else could he go? We belonged to one another.I loved my husband. I loved him so much. I never actually stopped.I just stopped coming home.A week after I left I received a long, apologetic text. Paragraphs that included the words “I’d do anything to smell one of your chickens in the oven.”It seems hilarious now that he would try to tempt me back home by asking me to cook him a meal. At the time, however, it wasn’t wholly ineffective. I was jerked back to the illusion of a home that floats on the scent of a dinner prepared with care. The memories made my hands shake.Once I moved, I roasted more chickens. To christen my new apartment, to feed friends who marveled at how well I seemed to be doing, given the circumstances. It dawned on me that those golden birds were the ultimate act of love, spiked with garlic, and no one deserved it more than them. I made them because once we’d eaten every morsel, I could boil the bones into a soup that tasted even more deeply of comfort. Of home and family, and all those seemingly fixed notions that had turned on their heads in just a few weeks.All that life-affirming goodness, the strength and energy buried within the marrow, was drawn out when it found itself in hot water.Just like me.When I eventually started dating someone, we agreed to keep it casual. In my kitchen, full of bravado and IPAs, I fed him a line I’d tried on my girlfriends a few nights before: “It’s hard to be a woman: Someone makes you come a few times and the next thing you know, there’s a damn chicken in the oven.”He looked over at me and said, “I can make the chicken.” Like it was the most obvious thing in the world. I was too shocked to respond.But I let him. And it was delicious.This essay is part of a partnership between Human Parts and The Chorus, a new publication about relationships, dating, and friendship from Chorus.Written by"
35,White Fever Dreams,"The new West Side Story revival attempts to reinterpret the classical music for a contemporary audience in a fraught political climate. It is Romeo and Juliet, but with tattoos and ripped clothing and barely suppressed rage rolling beneath the skin of every character. It is a story of old immigrants versus new immigrants, and how people living on the margins are forced to fight for the little scrap of the world they share. The cast is multiracial and the Sharks are played by actual people of color instead of white actors in brown face so that, I suppose, is progress. The Jets are not just disaffected white men but also black.The stage is vast and ominously bare. The most interesting parts of the set — Doc’s store and the bridal shop, are found deep into the stage and parts are hidden from view. When action takes place in those spaces, it is projected onto massive screens, stretching across the stage. Sometimes, cast members film the action on stage. Other times, pre-recorded segments supplement the live action. Like far too many shows in recent years, West Side Story relies heavily, too heavily in fact, on projections that are expected to do the work stagecraft should.Tonally, this West Side Story is significantly different from the original. “Gee, Officer Krupke,” is the most reimagined and affecting number. In the original, the song is supposed to be a farcical but prescient romp. In this revival, it becomes a commentary on police brutality and what it means to live in a surveillance state. The staging of this number is smart, if a bit heavy-handed, and a necessary reminder of the ways black and brown men are imperiled by systemic racism.Taken one way, fear is this revival’s center of gravity and the talented cast acquit themselves well to the task. The choreography is frenetic and electrifying. The singing is raw, rough and angry. As dancers, the cast is uniformly talented though not every cast member has a strong enough voice to handle the show’s vocal demands. Shereen Pimental, as Maria, is the real standout. Her voice is flawless, and she has a magnetic stage presence. Tony, played by Isaac Powell, is a formidable actor with genuine appeal, but his voice falters and cannot adequately carry the passion of “Maria” or the yearning of “Somewhere.” Yesenia Ayala captivates as Anita when she’s on stage and is a formidable dancer, deliberate and confident in her movement.And then there is Amar Ramasar, who plays Bernardo, Maria’s brother and the leader of the Sharks. On the night I saw the show, still in previews, there were several protestors in front of the Broadway Theatre, with posters warning theatregoers about a sexual predator in the cast. I had no idea who they were protesting until the next day when I learned Ramasar was fired from the New York City Ballet for sharing nude pictures of a woman in the company without her consent. Though I was unaware, the show’s producers certainly knew of his history and clearly didn’t care. Only eighteen months passed between when Ramasar was fired from the ballet and when he began performing as Bernardo. The quality of his performance is irrelevant but if talent was a justifiable reason to overlook sexual misconduct, Ramasar’s presence in the show is wildly unjustified. It is all but impossible to respect a show that shows so little respect for itself or the women in its cast.Overall, the experience of West Side Story is kind of unpleasant but all things considered, discomfort is appropriate. There is a generation of young people who must deal with a burning planet, unchecked gun violence that is somehow supposed to abate with the power of thoughts and prayer, unchecked police brutality, the erosion of privacy, the downfall of democracy, stagnant wages and limited job opportunities, staggering student loan debt, healthcare as a privilege instead of a right, rising rents and home ownership as an elusive fantasy. A show that tries to speak to this reality demands setting complacency and comfort aside.There is a generation of young people who must deal with a burning planet, unchecked gun violence that is somehow supposed to abate with the power of thoughts and prayerThe new staging seems quite forward-looking and inclusive but most of the creative and production team is comprised of white people. Ivo van Hove, Belgian, directs and Anne Teresa DeKeersmaeker, Dutch, choreographs this new staging. They are accomplished and talented, certainly, and they do bring a sharp and interesting energy to this revival. But how committed can a show be to genuine inclusion when people of color have little or no hand in the show’s artistic voice and direction? How authentic can the portrayals of people of color be when it is predominantly white people shaping those portrayals?The show’s attempts at inclusion are, at times, clumsily executed. The black Jets would have more solidarity with the Puerto Rican Sharks than the white Jets. That they don’t in this show is the misstep of people who did not bother to learn much about the cultures they tried to represent. During “Gee Officer Krupke,” there are, among others, images of the border wall between the United States and Mexico. It’s clear what they are trying to say but it is also cognitively dissonant because Puerto Rico is part of the United States, and it is an island and the show is set in present day. To flatten the experience immigration without nuance makes it seem like the show’s architects think all brown people and their experiences are interchangeable.In graduate school many years ago, we read a book in a pedagogy seminar about racial discrimination in higher education. One of my classmates said she took the book and its claims more seriously when she realized the author was white. I’ve never forgotten that. For a great many people, whiteness is synonymous with authority. Whiteness endows people with this presumed authority on any subject including the experiences of people of color.It is interesting to consider the cultural missteps of West Side Story as the literary world remains embroiled in a debate about Jeanine Cummin’s American Dirt. In the novel, Lydia and her young son Luca must flee Mexico after members of the fictional Los Jardineros cartel murder their entire family as they celebrate a quinceanera. If there is a cliché about Mexico, Cummins finds a way to exhaust it. Lydia’s backstory is realized through flashbacks and the revelation of the catalyst for the massacre is so facile, so absurd. The pace is breathless, Lydia trying desperately to get her child to safety, and it is the one thing that works well. As a thriller demands, Lydia and Luca face obstacle after obstacle after obstacle. As relentless as the novel is, the ending falters because what, really, is there to say after our protagonists, flatly drawn, more caricature than character, experience every possible trauma.At the end of the book is a very long, very self-serving author’s note — a way of pre-empting controversy but instead, it inflames. Cummins says she wanted to humanize the migrants who are trying to cross the United States border but who, exactly is she trying to do this for? Who cannot see other people with whom we are sharing this planet as human? Who cannot empathize with what we know of how treacherous the journey into the United States can be? Who cannot empathize with families being separated, children being kept in cages? If a poorly written and conceived novel is what it takes, are these people we really want to reach?Cummins says she wanted to humanize the migrants who are trying to cross the United States border but who, exactly is she trying to do this for? Who cannot see other people with whom we are sharing this planet as human?Cummins has repeatedly discussed the extensive research she conducted. In fairness, you do see evidence of research on the pages of American Dirt. In fact, the book screams, “Look at me! I have done my research,” which happens when a writer desperately wants you to know they really, truly, have put in the necessary work to credibly write their book. There is a difference, though, between conducting research and synthesizing the significance of what you have learned. Time and again, Cummins demonstrates her cultural ignorance that no amount of research can overcome. For one, Lydia and Luca are Mexican when most of the migrants trying to cross the border are Central American. Lydia is a bookshop owner who displays her young son at the front of her store where white tourists marvel at his knowledge of geography as if a mother would willingly treat her child like an animal in a zoo. There are so many avoidable missteps in American Dirt, places where the author is clearly intellectualizing experiences she knows nothing about or is incapable of truly understanding.The author also tries, tenuously, to create connections between her life and the migrant experience. She talks about trauma and tragedy in her family. She talks about her Irish husband, an undocumented immigrant before their marriage, but she acts as if an undocumented white man who arrived by airplane is at all comparable to any undocumented person of color. In a 2016 New York Times op-ed about a traumatic experience in her family, Cummins wrote, “I am white.” In the months leading up to the publishing of American Dirt, she began to claim Puerto Rican identity by way of a grandmother, going so far as to include the word “Boricua” in her Twitter bio treating racial identity like a costume. It would have been better if Cummins had simply written the book she wanted to write and allowed the critical reception to unfold without her clumsy attempts to control it.The publishing industry functions within an entire ecosystem of ignorance. In 2019, publisher Flatiron Books hosted a dinner in support of American Dirt. The centerpieces were small concrete walls wrapped in barbed wire, surrounded by candles and flowers. It was a thoughtless, callous display and no one, at least publicly, thought anything was wrong with aestheticizing trauma. An editor chose to buy this book, for an astonishing seven figures. Publicists worked to promote this book with great enthusiasm. If there were objections during the publication process, we will never know, and they probably went unheard because the people most likely to object had the least power or position to do so. I’m not sure what’s worse — that the team behind American Dirt did not anticipate the critical response or that they did, and simply didn’t care.If there were objections during the publication process, we will never know, and they probably went unheard because the people most likely to object had the least power or position to do so.Famous writers like Stephen King, Julia Alvarez, and Sandra Cisneros blurbed the book. The book will be translated into more than twenty languages. It was reviewed twice in the New York Times, and also received coverage in The Washington Post, The Atlantic, NPR, The Guardian, and The Los Angeles Times. While some reviews were negative, several were rapturous. Shortly before the book’s publication, Oprah announced that American Dirt was the latest selection for her popular book club and since, the book has sold robustly. It has received the most powerful endorsement in the literary word, despite its failings. American Dirt was positioned to succeed and despite the so-called backlash, this book has done exactly that. That such a flawed book was anointed and elevated while books by writers of color are ignored, unpublished, or inadequately compensated or supported, is the bitterest of pills to swallow. Writer Myriam Gurba wrote a necessary and scathing review of American Dirt, calling out the author’s inadequacy to the task of writing about the perils of migration, the surfeit of clichés, the inept characterizations, the abject failure of the project. “Dirt is a Frankenstein of a book, a clumsy and distorted spectacle and while some white critics have compared Cummins to Steinbeck, I think a more apt comparison is to Vanilla Ice,” she concluded. Since her review was published, she has received harassment and threats for daring to take this book and author to task.Creativity demands that anyone should be able to tell the kinds of stories they want, but how those stories are told matters and creative freedom does not grant critical immunity. Perfection isn’t the goal, but accuracy and authenticity are. When people tell stories beyond their subject position, all too often they do it poorly. The depictions are caricatures, rife with stereotypes, flat and distorted. The people whose communities are so poorly represented speak up but are rarely heard. Writers are allowed to make mistakes.Writers are allowed to write bad books. To critique American Dirt isn’t about jealousy or misogyny or censorship. It’s about demanding better.Creativity demands that anyone should be able to tell the kinds of stories they want, but how those stories are told matters and creative freedom does not grant critical immunity.We seem to have forgotten that books are supposed to be discussed and vigorously critiqued. Unfortunately, we have a diminished culture of literary criticism, one where most books are not substantively engaged with and where readers and writers expect either unequivocal praise or polite silence.Both West Side Story and American Dirt were supposed to tell big and bold, new and innovative stories about black and brown people, but in their execution, they were fever dreams of white people. That is a very old story, indeed. Lest you think audiences are deterred, American Dirt debuted on the New York Times bestseller list at №1. West Side Story is running at 100% capacity and for the week ending on January 26th, it was the fourth highest grossing show on Broadway. Both the publishing and theatre communities have been wringing their hands for years about diversity and inclusion, and creating space for a multitude of voices. And still, they never make the real efforts to practice inclusivity rather than simply lamenting the need for it. They never put the sustained material support behind diversity and inclusion initiatives. They refuse to develop institutional fail-safes to ensure that the best possible work is being made. Given the success of both American Dirt and West Side Story, they clearly have little incentive to do so.Written by"
36,How To Become Emotionally Self-Sufficient,"There’s a German saying that translates like this: The worst way of missing someone is to sit next to them, knowing they’ll never be with you.For three years, I had sat next to her, and it was never going to work. Three long years of being in love with my best friend, that’s what it took for me to finally admit: “I will never be with this girl.”I distinctly remember the day. It’s one of those rare memories you can access like a Youtube video. You click a button, and, instantly, you can see it. Clearly.When I hit play on this one, I see myself sitting at my desk, crying. I was 18 years old. I don’t cry a lot, but this one hurt. Deep down, I had known for a while we’d never be together, but it was still overwhelming.As much as I felt sad, I also felt relieved. Finally, I was free. Finally, I could move on. Some of my tears were happy tears. This is the most distinct part of the memory. I sat in my desk chair, thinking: “Well, at least I still have myself. I guess I’ll always have myself.”Sometimes, I joke that, whenever I have to be alone, at least I’ll be in good company. It’s funny, but it’s also true. I can’t trace back this feeling any further than that memory. That day, I understood a huge emotional investment had failed, but I also realized my parents raised me to be my own best friend.That’s a lot to take in, and that’s why I was crying.Emotional self-sufficiency is the foundation of good mental health. It’s also fertile ground for happiness. The better you can deal with your emotions, the more positive moments you can extract from even the worst of situations.Finally, emotional maturity is attractive in the most literal sense of the world. When you can identify, analyze, process, and manage your feelings well, the world takes notice. Opportunities, responsibilities, and relationships start gravitating towards you because people know you can handle them.I was lucky. I lived a sheltered, complete childhood. Few people get that. But I also never stopped working on myself. In the ten years that followed that memory, I maintained and improved my ability to identify, accept, act on and move on from my emotions.You can’t change your upbringing after the fact, but you can work on emotional self-sufficiency. Emotionally mature people have certain traits. By emulating them as best as you can, you can learn to take responsibility for your feelings.It’s a slow process, not always easy, and there is no one right way to do it, but here are three exercises that have given me strength and stability throughout the years.The hardest and most important part of emotional self-sufficiency is not running away when your feelings make you uncomfortable.It’s easy to gloss over negative emotions and “try to stay positive,” as we’re often told. Sadly, doing so further obfuscates our feelings rather than clarify them. We may think we’ve handled our sadness, fear, or disappointment when, actually, we haven’t even identified which one causes our discomfort.This is the first task of emotional self-sufficiency: finding emotional clarity. It requires spending time with yourself, thinking, and holding off on judgments so you don’t jump to false conclusions.Our age affects our ability to label emotionally laden situations, and, usually, we become worse at it as we grow up. When do you ever hear an adult say, “I’m afraid?” Children, however, confess to being scared all the time. Of course, they are less burdened with responsibilities. Kids have time. As adults, we must make said time to gain emotional clarity.Before I had my “breakthrough,” I spent many nights sitting by myself, mulling over the situation with my then-best friend. Few of them led to tangible answers, but they all fed into the final revelation.The second part of being emotionally responsible is sitting with what you have identified. Like waiting for the initial fog to clear, this requires emotional tolerance. Your feelings can’t kill you, but it is only when you sit with the bad ones and realize the world keeps turning that you start trusting in this fact.Today, our challenges are almost exclusively emotional. Leaning into your feelings gives you the power to accept them without letting them hijack your behavior. You want to act, not react. What distinguishes the two is a plan; a plan formed with time.Sitting with your emotions as a standalone activity is crucial to separating other people’s behavior from how you feel about said behavior. Initially, our gut tells us the two are one and the same, but they’re not. For example, while I was angry that the girl I was in love with didn’t reciprocate my feelings, I had no idea what she felt or why she acted the way she did. So who was I to judge? It was my anger, and all I could do was resolve it — and that took time.The next time you feel particularly uncomfortable, tempted to act on an impulse, or as if you’re on the verge of a nervous breakdown, go home. Sit. Make some tea. Put on some music. Think. Rest. Let your true feelings bubble to the surface, and then take a bath inside those emotions.It may still feel uncomfortable at first, but after a while, you’ll get a sense of relief and new clarity on what’s going on inside your body and mind.Writing is thinking. Every sentence has structure. You can’t write without structuring your thoughts, and since your thoughts are your responses to your emotions, writing is structuring your emotional responses.There are countless forms of writing. None of them demand you publicly post your results, but almost all of them let you shape your emotional landscape.There’s journaling, which you can do in a five-minute format, by answering a single question, along certain themes, like Stoicism, or in a free-writing style where you document your stream of consciousness in real-time. There are quizzes and personality tests, the idea of a personal manifesto, and many lists of values, rules, and principles, all of which can facilitate emotional clarity.Once you’ve picked up on certain character traits, attitudes, or beliefs you hold — if even just for a period of time — identifying how you feel about and want to handle things gets easier in similar, future situations.Meditation is humility in its purest form. You just sit there. You don’t act. You don’t think. At least, you’re not trying to. For a few minutes a day, you allow yourself to merely exist, and you teach yourself that that’s actually okay.I used to think meditation was about self-awareness, but it’s also about non-judgment. You’ll learn to not label your thoughts, feelings, and experiences so quickly. Sometimes, you’ll even realize you can’t decide if something is good or bad at all — and you just accept it as is.For the past 150 days, I have meditated each day. Usually, I do it for 15 minutes after waking up, but even as little as five minutes helps.By tuning in to yourself and listening to what comes to the surface, you gain emotional clarity. You also practice emotional tolerance, as you’re literally just tolerating the passage of time. Finally, it lets you approach situations more humbly, as you’re not so quick to judge.There are many ways to meditate, but I like the simple version: Just sit comfortably, close your eyes, and reset your train of thought when you catch yourself chasing a mental path. Sometimes, I focus on my breath or the noises in my environment, but as long as I make an effort to stay present, it works.Start with a few minutes a day, ease in to what might feel uncomfortable at first, and then go from there.Emotional self-sufficiency isn’t being immune to losing your shit. We all have moments of overwhelm and despair. It’s about not letting those moments dictate your life.It takes a lot of standing up to catch yourself when you fall, but if you can do both, you’ll always land safely, even when the touchdown isn’t soft. You’ll have faith in yourself and feel you can handle whatever life throws at you. You’ll be calmer, more stable, and attract many good things in your life, from happiness to opportunities and relationships.Get a journal. Meditate a little. Make time to sit with your emotions. Give these exercises a try. The next time you find yourself shedding a tear, maybe you’ll remember that, at least you’ll always have yourself.Written by"
37,4 Japanese Concepts to Transform Your State of Mind,"Japan has a famed rich culture and philosophy, but I confess I did not appreciate this enough until my first trip. At 21, I was a Karate black belt and thought far too much of my own ability.The training involved lots of head nodding at Japanese words being used without really being explained. You knew you were doing something wrong but didn’t quite know why.That all changed in the beautiful islands of Okinawa.Traveling to the birthplace of Karate transformed my understanding. The instructors there have dedicated their lives to the art form and inspired me to dive into the philosophical elements, not just looking cool.The lessons Japanese philosophy teaches can be applied to all aspects of our lives.We can often allow our minds to float and be forced to react to the challenges that life throws at us. We can, however, practice and discipline our minds to do so much more.Mind without mind sounds wishy-washy, yet for those who have experienced it, there is no better feeling.This mindset is where your inner voice is silent. You act purely based on instinct and feel. For many of us who are continually worrying, mental silence is incredibly freeing.In sports, it is often called being in “The Zone,” where everything just seems to flow for a player.Meditation is a tried and tested way to attain “Mushin no shin,” yet meditation is not something that appeals to everyone.Have you ever aimlessly gone for a walk, and your legs just have taken you around without any conscious decisions about where you are going? Total empty mindedness, but your subconscious guides you.People experience “Mushin no shin” in a vast array of fields. People report it in physical activities such as dance, running, karate, and others find it in mental or creative areas such as painting or doing sudoku.I believe everyone should have an activity that gives them this feeling. We all struggle when we first start an activity because we must think so hard about what we are doing. Getting through this difficulty eventually leads to cognitive ease.The key to “Mushin no shin” is consistency in whichever activity you choose. This activity then becomes an oasis during your day or week.While I would caution against trying to force this mindset to be used productively rather than purely for mental health, it is possible to achieve in a working environment too.Have you ever had a day where it’s just flown by, and you have no idea where the time went? It happens when you have all the necessary skills for your tasks, and your brain simply plows through.It can be great for the first attempt or draft of a piece of work. Instead of your inner voice assessing every word or action you make, you let it run wild and afterward in a more focused state can edit and revise.You may already have activities that put your brain into this state. If you do, make sure you make time for this and see how it lifts your overall mood. If you do not, what are you waiting for!Conjure the image of a samurai in your mind. What many will think of is a majestic warrior with an extreme discipline that exudes calm.On January 1st, many of us were in this state of mind. We would complete our New Year’s Resolution, no matter what.Unfortunately, it’s all too easy to fall out of this state of mind. True “Fudoshin” is an irresistible will to reach our target that will bulldoze through any distraction, whether internal or external.Often “Fudoshin” can work against us. If you have a sweet tooth, you know no matter what reasoning or logic you use, you will eat that cake.We can train ourselves to harness this state for good. Whenever trying to give up something, whether it’s smoking, snacks, or meat, a refusal to entertain the possibility that you will fail will work. It is saying ‘No’ instantly and firmly.A straightforward way to practice this mindset and gain confidence for more difficult tasks is delaying gratification. Studies have shown that this is a reliable indicator of success.If you’re addicted to your phone. Try to decide that you will not look at it for the next X minutes. Do this regularly until there’s no doubt in your mind at all that you’ll get through your time.Then try a slightly more laborious task and roll on to tackle more and more challenging situations.The greatest mistake people make when trying to harness “Fudoshin” is setting their aims to high too quickly. Instead of deciding to go to the gym every single day, start with going to the gym at least once a week with no excuses.This easier task develops the desire to harness the excellent control you have inside.Right now, I am using “Fudoshin” that I will complete this article and publish it regardless of the other distractions of my life.“Fudoshin” can be applied in all areas of life. If you make a promise to a friend, then you will not break it, there are no ifs or buts. Even more importantly, if you make a promise to yourself, then you will not let yourself down and won’t even consider that possibility.Finals are littered with stories of glory moments where a team comes from behind to steal the trophy at the last moment.This is what happens when “Fudoshin” meets a lack of “Zanshin.”“Zanshin” is where even when a task is going well, and everything seems alright, you do not allow the mind to relax. It’s a laser focus that only ends when the mission is complete.Many of us will be guilty of starting to win and getting ahead of ourselves and becoming complacent. Whether it is in work or play, it’s always disappointing to be snatched from the loving embrace of victory at the last moment.We must appreciate what got us to our advantageous position and not let our guard down.It doesn’t matter if you were winning for 99% of the contest if you lose it at the very end. In politics, the belief that Brexit or Trump could never win may have led to weaker opposition campaigns and then shock defeats.Multitasking is ineffective whenever both tasks are cognitively difficult. Yet we still try to do so.If you are working while also thinking about something from your personal life, then you will not be as effective.Following a “Zanshin” mindset means resolute focus until the task is complete because allowing the mind to wander can and probably will backfire.To train “Zanshin,” be ruthless with your attention. If you are out with dinner with friends, then you are out with dinner with friends until the last moment. Do not start thinking about tomorrow while you are with them, as they will remember you zoning out at the end!If more people maintained “Shoshin,” the world would be a better place.How often have you gone into a conversation wanting to prove the other person wrong?Our brains are capable of incredible learning and growth, but this is only possible if our minds are open to new information.Our existing views and prejudices get in the way of our potential.Being good is the enemy of being great.Many people obtain black belts and then give up because they think they know everything. However, with hindsight, I learned more in the first year post-black belt then the entire time preceding.It is unnervingly common for people to follow a view of an influencer on Twitter and believe that they are now experts on the topic. We see this, especially with politically charged issues.An essential aspect of Shoshin is the acceptance that you can be wrong, and you can grow and adapt. If you can never believe you are wrong, how will you ever grow?“Shoshin” can also be applied to personal relationships. We can sometimes convince ourselves that a person has acted with specific intentions despite having no evidence! “Shoshin” means listening and trying to understand others and being open to apologizing.One of the most challenging aspects of maintaining “Shoshin” is maintaining conviction at the same time. Being open does not mean being riddled with self-doubt.Paradoxically, people living with forms of anxiety can believe they are wrong often, and here the idea that needs to be grown and adapted is that they are not always wrong. Absolutes in the world are rare.Believe in yourself and critically your ability to grow. None of us are perfect, nor will we ever be, and that’s ok. Letting go of this idea gives us space to develop without guilt.As a practice exercise, think about the last argument you had. Try to put yourself in the other person’s shoes and think about what their arguments were and whether any of them could be valid.Read articles by people with different opinions with you and try to understand their perspective. This does not mean that you must change your mind, but at the very least, you will have learned something about how others think.Sometimes you will come across someone malicious, yet this should not be our base position for everyone we disagree with.This article highlights four states of mind from Japanese philosophy:Thank you for reading this article, I hope you can apply some of the lessons to improve your mental wellbeing.Written by"
38,Review: RetinaNet — Focal Loss (Object Detection),"In this story, RetinaNet, by Facebook AI Research (FAIR), is reviewed. It is discovered that there is extreme foreground-background class imbalance problem in one-stage detector. And it is believed that this is the central cause which makes the performance of one-stage detectors inferior to two-stage detectors.In RetinaNet, an one-stage detector, by using focal loss, lower loss is contributed by “easy” negative samples so that the loss is focusing on “hard” samples, which improves the prediction accuracy. With ResNet+FPN as backbone for feature extraction, plus two task-specific subnetworks for classification and bounding box regression, forming the RetinaNet, which achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforms Faster R-CNN, the well-known two-stage detectors. It is a 2017 ICCV Best Student Paper Award paper with more than 500 citations. (The first author, Tsung-Yi Lin, has become Research Scientist at Google Brain when he was presenting RetinaNet in 2017 ICCV.) (Sik-Ho Tsang @ Medium)By using focal loss, the total loss can be balanced adaptively between easy samples and hard samples.[2017 ICCV] [RetinaNet]Focal Loss for Dense Object DetectionImage Classification[LeNet] [AlexNet] [ZFNet] [VGGNet] [SPPNet] [PReLU-Net] [DeepImage] [GoogLeNet / Inception-v1] [BN-Inception / Inception-v2] [Inception-v3] [Inception-v4] [Xception] [MobileNetV1] [ResNet] [Pre-Activation ResNet] [RiR] [RoR] [Stochastic Depth] [WRN] [FractalNet] [Trimps-Soushen] [PolyNet] [ResNeXt] [DenseNet]Object Detection[OverFeat] [R-CNN] [Fast R-CNN] [Faster R-CNN] [DeepID-Net] [R-FCN] [ION] [MultiPathNet] [NoC] [G-RMI] [TDM] [SSD] [DSSD] [YOLOv1] [YOLOv2 / YOLO9000] [FPN]Semantic Segmentation[FCN] [DeconvNet] [DeepLabv1 & DeepLabv2] [ParseNet] [DilatedNet] [PSPNet] [DeepLabv3]Biomedical Image Segmentation[CUMedVision1] [CUMedVision2 / DCAN] [U-Net] [CFS-FCN] [U-Net+ResNet]Instance Segmentation[DeepMask] [SharpMask] [MultiPathNet] [MNC] [InstanceFCN] [FCIS]Super Resolution[SRCNN] [FSRCNN] [VDSR] [ESPCN] [RED-Net]Written by"
39,I Transformed My Figure in One Year,"As is so typical for this time of year, Medium and media in general are both flush with articles about body overhauls.We are as nation obsessed with our bodies, and so when the New Year rolls around, by god this is the year to do it right. Whatever IT happens to be. Lose weight, exercise more, yadda yadda.Rinse, repeat.For those of us with more than two decades under our belts, we don’t write as many resolutions as much younger folk, if for no other reason than we’ve been known to greet the New Year by writing about losing weight while wielding a donut in the other hand.Boy is my hand up. You learn to develop a sense of humor about the whole process.Not just that, but after a while the get-thin-quick schemes are the same as get-rich-quick schemes which are the same as pretty much all schemes for that matter.Get lathered up, rinse, repeat.One of the reasons I write about fitness after fifty is that I land in that very narrow category of folks who dumped one hell of a lot of weight a very long time ago and have managed to keep it off. For anyone who, like me, has tried every diet under the sun and the moon included, not only have I completely trashed my metabolism (it’s very slow, trust me, after what I did) but I will never quite be able to eat the daily recommended for my age and weight.Look, I’m thin, and muscular, but given my activity level, any dietician would recommend easily twice the calories I consume right now. I can’t do that. Because once you’ve exorcised (note I did NOT say exercise) that extra poundage, the body makes the decision to slow down and begins the lifelong negotiation to get it all back.Well, shit.I can attest. However I’ve been successful for 33 years and counting. I rise a few pounds from stress, it goes away. I drop a few pounds on a trip, it comes back. The difference is that not only is it manageable, it’s not something that determines my daily happiness. Being fit does. Having strength and mobility and flexibility add to my happiness, for I have options one hell of a lot of folks don’t. At any age. I’ve been willing to do the work. And no, it’s not fun to be this disciplined. But I don’t care for the alternatives.By now I have more than thirty years’ of practice. I didn’t dump 80 lbs just last year. And therein lies the issue I have withFirst of all, that’s a ridiculous promise. The writer doesn’t have a clue what’s going to work for anyone but himself. But that clickbait title got him more than five thousand views. Because we are gullible, and we want easy answers, and look if it worked for him, then…No.Besides, Sparky, let’s see that body in another year. Or five.While the article had some good advice, what was suggested assumed a number of things: that you’re young (being white and male don’t hurt either), have enough money to afford the suggested foods and gym membership, and haven’t spent a good part of your life on yo-yo diets which have already fucked up your metabolism.Which, kindly, given that some 40% of us in America are obese, is probably most of us.I can understand both the enthusiasm of the author as well as the eagerness of the readers to find THAT MAGIC THING THAT WORKS.There is none. There just isn’t any one thing, or any one program, that works. Period.Some years ago a good friend of mine, a fellow professional speaker, finally decided to get serious about his obesity. He had an enormous waistline and his friends and wife were concerned. He had a great fondness for grazing at all-you-can-eat smorgasbords. He turned that energy towards the Body for Life program.Phillips’ website featured endless Before and Afters. We LOVE Before and After photos. We wanna be that After. My buddy threw himself into it. He made one fatal mistake. He was in his mid-sixties. He decided that he was going to return his much-abused, badly out of shape body to his early twenties. So he carried around a photo of a professional body builder and told all of us that this was what he was going to look like in twelve weeks.I don’t need to tell you what happened. His program stalled when he realized that not only was that completely out of the question, he couldn’t cope with the fact that even after having lost a very respectable fifty pounds, he would never, ever sport a 32"" waist again. He gave up, dumped the effort. Last time I saw him he was even bigger. He wanted an After he couldn’t reach. And my guess is that if you and I researched all those other Body for Life Afters, a good portion of them didn’t find that After was Forever After either.Having unrealistic expectations is guaranteed to torpedo you.And, for those who have lost a huge amount of weight, this happens. You come face to face with acres of rippling skin that used to stretch over all that fat, and now it just hangs. And, as the article points out, the BIG JOY doesn’t happen. Because the weight isn’t the issue. Never was. My life didn’t suddenly improve when the 80 lbs went away. That would be another twenty-four years later. And, these days, I have some sagging, which is a prime indicator that my skin was once full of a lot more of me. You ready to sign up for that? Yours could be sooner or later. No guarantee it will ever get better. Either way, it depends.Man I hate to bust 5000+ bubbles, but Dude, all you and I can do is speak to what works for our unique bodies. Telling people to work out certain body parts on different days? Well, kindly, that may not work for folks’ work schedules, maybe they can’t spring for a gym membership, perhaps they are infirm or obese or whatever and the exercises are just way too far out of the realm of possibility, or to get started requires a $100 an hour personal trainer.I could go on. Again, as with everything in life, it depends.Anyone can sustain high enthusiasm for a short term result (as in, getting laid) but when it becomes real work (as in, giving her an orgasm), ZZZZZZ.If you’re easily discouraged, and you have the expectation that your yeoman’s effort should result in a six-pack and you’re not a natural mesomorph, this could be a very frustrating journey.I don’t argue anyone’s right to brag about getting fitter, dropping the flab and being able to pose prettily for the camera in front of a karst outcropping in Thailand.For my health dollar, that’s no different from posting a fitness model on the wall at 24-Hour and implying that you, too, can look like this airbrushed dude who does nothing other than work out full time to look like that.People who write these articles are justifiably proud and they want to encourage others. However it strikes me as irresponsible to imply that just do this and you will get that. Because our bodies don’t work that way .Because those, and other tough but essential queries will cut the eyeballs down to the few who really will be inspired.There are some basics, which are perfectly outlined here. But there is also this, which is essential for those who are currently carrying a great deal more weight. The human body is a quirk machine and as such, Diet #1 is perfect for Billy Bob and for shit for Norma Jean. For damned good reason.Bottom line, this whole fitness thing is such a unique journey. There is no one body style that is perfect, only what you have, and the best fitness you can hope to achieve based on your work ethic. And, finding something you enjoy.There is only ONE version of you, and because of that, only YOU can determine what works for you. You can hire help via a nutritionist, a dietician, a doctor, a trainer. But ultimately, no matter what magical formula some happy dude or dudette on Medium or elsewhere used, it is meaningless when it comes to determining what is going to work for you.Just ask me. I’ve had 33 years of practice. I wouldn’t tell you to do it my way because I’m all I can fit in this skin suit. There’s no room for you in here (there used to be, but I like the extra room in the hips). You gotta figure that out your own.And besides, I really am not terribly interested in anyone else’s Big Success Story until they’ve kept it up like my Medium Peep Katie Andrews, who went from 425 to 160. Now it’s been years.Not days.That’s what makes a success story. Sustainable. Enjoyable. A lifestyle.What worked for Katie wouldn’t work for me. Or you. Or likely anyone else. We all have to tweak constantly as we evolve.Damn, man. It all comes back around to much the same thing.So yes, I did transform my body in a year. Thirty three years ago. And no, I’m not telling you my diet or exercise plan. Trust me, you would not do what I do to be able to do what I do in the world. Very few people would (and besides, I wouldn’t wish my injuries on you).What I do is fun for me and looks like torture to any (sane, sober, otherwise competent) human being.This is your body. Your year. Your journey. Wanna be fit? Stop reading other peoples’ stories and go write your own.Written by"
40,That Good Ol’ Fashioned Grey-Area Depression,"A couple months back, a young woman asked me how she could delineate between sadness and depression. Did she deserve to call herself “a depressed person”? She wasn’t sure. I told her my personal Depression Litmus Test is when I take a right at sadness and drive straight off a cliff into a sea of I Don’t Care. “I’m less productive, I feel like everything I’m doing is pointless, I stop caring about things I normally would,” I wrote.It didn’t surprise me that she would second-guess her emotions. Many people have a limited understanding of what depression looks like (so many looks!). And even those of us who do know can still find ourselves competing for legitimacy in the Depression Olympics (sponsored by Twitter, probably). Did I eat enough cheese today? Could my sweatpants use a couple more stains? Does this two-month bender put me in the running for the title? The depression title, of course. Sometimes it feels like it has to be earned, as though simply being depressed isn’t enough. That in owning the title, you also have to own the nebulous persona that comes with it.But depression isn’t a persona. It’s a mood disorder and an illness, not a uniform one throws on to express their inner turmoil. There are several depressive disorders as outlined by the DSM 5 — add to that subjective life experience and a multitude of mental health variables, and it’s difficult to argue that depression could ever manifest as a one-size-fits-all, grey-scale cloak. Your depression could look very different from someone else’s, different from the archetype — but that doesn’t invalidate it. And that doesn’t make it harmless.I know this. So why, after moving cross-country to Los Angeles, did it take months of lethargy, apathy, and nihilism for me to recognize what was happening?The first time I felt depressed… what a funny-sad way to start a sentence. As if I know. I used to have this tidy little depression origin story: things were just swell until the year I turned thirteen. That year, 1999, my family and I abruptly moved from Brooklyn to a suburb of New York City. The move made me aware of a few things: 1) I could not trust my treasonous parents, 2) The only person who mourned my moving away was me, 3) cutting myself was an adequate way to deal with items 1) and 2).This narrative worked for me for a long time. I remember vividly the pain of leaving the apartment I grew up in, my friends, my neighborhood. I remember transforming the journal I kept for English class into a tortured babble book — crying and bleeding directly onto the pages, purposely writing through meltdowns to convey, through shaky handwriting, how fucked I was. How fucked everything was. I remember graduating from bobby pin to scissors to knife in the cavernous bedroom with the air mattress and the beige, wall-to-wall carpeting.But in packing for my recent move west, I discovered my origin story might’ve begun before that. Before I left Brooklyn, which I would go on to mythologize as The Place Where Nothing Bad Ever Happened. The evidence that my narrative was incomplete came in the form of an old letter from my best friend, circa sixth grade. It was written in purple milk pen and while the pages were water-warped, the words were still legible. “Please don’t kill yourself!” And “I’m depressed, too — but don’t end it. If you wanna runaway, I know a place that can help us,” my friend wrote. I don’t know what I wrote to her to prompt this response. I do know I was eleven.It’s tempting to dismiss my feelings as those of a mid-puberty, emotional tween, but as I would go on to attempt suicide at fifteen, I’m not sure that’s accurate. I’m also not sure what was so terrible for eleven-year-old me — perhaps nothing. Perhaps this thing was inherited, same as my freckles, the color of my eyes. Who knows? What I do know is that these formative experiences went on to define depression as it pertained to me: it involved crying for hours on end, self-harm, and the constant feeling that the world would be fine without me in it.By that definition, I was not depressed when I moved to California. In fact, those first few weeks were abnormally blissful. Moving cross-country, alone, was a feat I hadn’t imagined myself capable of — I even began therapy earlier that year for the express purpose of building up the internal tools I was lacking just to pull it off.I landed at LAX on a Postcard October Day and knew almost instantly that I would not miss the autumn creep that had already taken hold of New York. I would not miss the clockwork depression that promised to visit the season after that, either. Finding an apartment I could afford by myself was the cherry on my self-sufficiency cake. Moving to LA made me feel like both an adult and a teenager at the same time — but not the teenager I’d been. Not the cutter. Not the cryer. I was a Polaroid teen, living in a perpetual golden hour. I was sunbeam beamin’. I was, by all accounts, not depressed. Not immediately, anyway, and even then, not in the way I’d come to define it.Self-medication is a bitch. It works, there’s no denying that. But how well? For how long? What’s worse: acknowledging that you’re depressed, or creating a new reason to feel bad about yourself while the old reasons drone on in the background?It took about two months for me to settle in after the move. To acquire an apartment, and then a desk, and then a chair suitable for desk-sitting. I gave myself permission, in the meantime, to work less and play more. Eventually, I’d return to my anxious, Type-A, Virgo self. I’d earn some money, write, make myself worthy of the life the former me had stitched together. But not yet.And then, not ever. I was partying a lot, enjoying the kind of freedom I had previously decided didn’t belong to me. She of no safety net, of no spousal or parental support. In New York, it made sense to live to work. I didn’t have many alternatives. But taking a time-out from the grind agreed with my body — more specifically, with my anxiety. Why go back to being that person? That palpitation-hearted, fire-chested person?It’s a strange thing — to care so much about every detail, to require medication to ward off the excessive, destructive worry — only to turn around and not care about anything.The depression I was accustomed to involved a lot of kicking and screaming. This was not that. This was laying in bed for days at a time until it felt like my spinal cord had melted into my mattress. Watching hundreds of hours of cancelled TV shows instead of responding to emails. Leaving bed only to heat a frozen pizza or to drink with friends. This was berating myself for being lazy, even as my “laziness” began to feel more like some unshakeable condition I’d had since birth. This was thinking, “You’d probably feel better if you went for a quick run, or maybe just stretched,” and, “It’s OK if you’re not gonna work today, but maybe reading a book would make you feel less shitty” — then ignoring that internal voice and pressing the “Continue Watching” button on Netflix.I had zero energy. Some days, I had zero emotions. I would walk around my apartment touching surfaces and craft supplies, almost amused by the way nothing warranted a response. “I feel like a robot,” I told a friend, robotically. When I managed to feel something, it was disdain for the act of caring. Why should I care?, I’d think, why should I care when we’re all gonna die? I didn’t necessarily want to die, I just became clear-eyed about the fact that it was an inevitability, one I’d done nothing to slow.During this period, I asked a friend if he thought he (we) maybe did some not-great things regarding his (our) health because he (we) figured it was only a matter of time. Do we hurt ourselves to speed up the process, to take ownership of our lives? If we’re to blame for our ultimate demise, doesn’t that take the control away from everyone, everything else? I still can’t decide if this line of thinking is a function of anxiety — worrying so much about death that you attempt to illogically defeat it by taking its options away, or depression — caring so little about your well-being that you actively assist in your own destruction. My guess is a little bit of both.Grey-area depression. It’s not a medical term, but it’s the best way to describe my first few months in California. On Consecutive Day #3 of laying in bed, I’d occasionally think, Maybe I’m depressed. Maybe. I just wasn’t sure, you know? Like the woman who wrote me, second-guessing her emotions. Like all of us for whom things feel bad, but not as bad as before — not as bad as the depressed character on that groundbreaking sitcom, not as bad as your depressed friend, whose suffering eclipses your own. Have we, those of us dwelling in the monochrome doldrums, earned the title?The problem with the grey area, with saying “maybe so,” is that you’re not compelled to figure out if there’s an actual problem. You find ways to write off all abnormal behavior: I just moved! I’m taking a self-care week! I’m just a disgusting, lazy, garbage human! And of course, the old standard: It’s just not that bad. Maybe it’s not, comparatively speaking, but there’s nothing good about it, either. And because I couldn’t differentiate between “not bad” and “good,” I spent months in cyclical malaise before talking to a professional and looking for solutions.So fuck the title. Fuck the archetype, the sweatpants, and the idea that you have to drown before you’re worth saving. Sometimes it’s enough to realize you’re sick of treading water.Written by"
41,How To Handle Other People’s Bad Moods Like a Pro,"Here’s a question I get asked a lot as a therapist:How do you sit there and listen to people’s problems all day? Don’t you get depressed?To be honest, not really.You might imagine that all the sadness, frustration, anxiety, and shame my clients tell me about would start to rub off on a guy after a while. But, if anything, I feel like I’m a little better at managing both my own emotions and other peoples’ because I get to practice all day long.The ability to manage other people’s bad moods and difficult emotions well is an ability that can be practiced and strengthened.What follows are 5 specific skills I’ve learned that help me to effectively and respectfully handle other people’s difficult emotions.If you can learn to cultivate them, these skills will help you keep your cool in every relationship in your life, especially the most important ones — like spouses, bosses, parents, partners, and children.When someone close to us is racked with anxiety, overwhelmed by sadness, or just incredibly frustrated, it’s natural to see their emotion as a problem — something to be taken care of and resolved quickly. This is why we so often turn to advice-giving when people we care about are upset.But as I’m sure you’ve come to learn, giving advice to someone in the throes of a bad mood is typically unhelpful at best and often counterproductive.Instead of viewing someone’s bad mood as a problem to be fixed, what if you shifted your perspective and saw it as a puzzle instead?Viewing someone’s emotion as a problem puts us in a moral frame of mind — we think of the emotion as something bad to be gotten rid of quickly.On the other hand, thinking of it as a puzzle puts us in a mindset of curiosity. And when we’re curious about another person’s emotion, it’s far easier to be validating, understanding, and empathetic, which is what most people experiencing strong, painful emotions really need.So, pay attention to your own self-talk when someone you care about is very emotional. How are you thinking about their emotion to yourself? Try to catch and hold back on thoughts like:And instead, substitute more curiosity-driven questions:When you shift from problem-thinking to puzzle-thinking, your mindset becomes driven by curiosity rather than morality, which is far more helpful in an emotionally-intense situation, both for you and the person across from you.When someone you care about is in a bad mood, try to understand how and why they’re feeling the way they are rather than how it can be fixed.Empathy is the act of putting yourself in another person’s shoes and trying to imagine what it must be like to live in their skin — with their thoughts, feelings, experiences, and circumstances.And while empathy is obviously an important skill to cultivate for all sorts of reasons, there’s a version of it that’s especially helpful for managing other people’s bad moods. I call it reverse empathy.Reverse empathy: rather than putting yourself in someone else’s shoes, try to remember a time when you wore the same shoe.In other words, try to recall a time when you struggled in a similar way and with a similar set of difficult emotions and mood.For example, if they’re really frustrated and angry, think back on a time when you were so frustrated you couldn’t seem to think straight:Often, reverse empathy can be a more powerful way to appreciate someone else struggle because it’s based on your own experiences rather than hypothetical ones.And the more you can relate yourself to what they’re going through, the better your odds of being genuinely helpful and supportive to the person next to you, not to mention being less reactive and emotional yourself.Without a doubt, the number one mistake I see people (especially couples) make in their communication with each other is that they get stuck in “Fix-it Mode.”Bob feels bad and starts describing how he feels and why he thinks he feels that way to Shelly. Because she sees that Bob is in pain and struggling, Shelly’s natural reaction is to try and alleviate or eliminate Bob’s suffering.But here’s the thing:Most people struggling emotionally don’t want someone to fix their pain, they went to feel understood.Bake that into your brain, because it’s one of the most counterintuitive but universally true laws of human psychology I can think of. And once you really believe it and start acting accordingly, everybody starts feeling better.So, how do we get out of a Fix-it mindset and start helping people feel understood? The best way is to practice a technique called Reflective Listening.Reflective Listening means that when someone tells you something, you simply reflect back to them what they said, either literally or with your own slight spin on it.For example:Now, I know this might sound silly or condescending at first blush, but I promise you it works.The reason is, it’s not about the content of what they’re saying, it’s about how they feel. Yes, they know and you know that they were really embarrassed at work. The real value of your reflecting back what they just said is that it helps them feel like you are with them, that you’re connected and understanding and on their side.By mirroring another person’s experience you’re giving them something far more valuable than advice — you’re giving them a genuine connection.One of the hardest things about other people’s bad moods is the emotions they tend to stir up in us.The trouble is, once we’re deep into a spiral of our own negative emotion, it’s hard to have enough mental and emotional bandwidth to navigate our own mood and that of someone else. This is why we often react to other people’s bad moods in a way that ultimately isn’t helpful to them, us, or the relationship.The solution is to get better at noticing and managing our own emotional responses early so that they don’t balloon out of control. And the best way I know of to do that is through a process called validation.Validation simply means acknowledging our own emotions and reminding ourselves that they’re okay and reasonable.For example, suppose your spouse or partner has been worked up all evening about some incident at work. They’re frustrated, angry, a little bit anxious, and there’s no sign of it letting up. While you’ve been able to tolerate it for the past couple hours, you feel yourself starting to get annoyed with them.Rather than a) acting on this annoyance and saying something unhelpful to your spouse, or b) becoming judgmental of yourself for feeling annoyed with them, you could validate your own annoyance.You could pause for a few seconds, acknowledge that you’re feeling annoyed and frustrated with your spouse, remind yourself that it’s okay and natural to feel that way, and then ask yourself what the most helpful way to move forward might be.A common pitfall I see people make when trying to deal effectively with other people’s bad moods is to overextend their responsibility to that person to include how they feel.Let me unpack that a bit:In short, because you can’t directly control how someone feels, you’re not responsible for it.So much unnecessary struggle, conflict, and wasted energy comes from a fundamental misunderstanding about what’s really under our control.On the other hand, it’s amazing how much genuinely helpful energy gets freed up when you remove the burden of excess responsibility from yourself.When you stop expecting to be able to make someone feel better, you can start taking real steps to connect with them in a heartfelt way and become genuinely supportive.Bad moods and painful emotions are hard to handle — both in ourselves and also in the people we work and live with. While it’s not possible to “fix” another person’s emotional struggles, there are a handful of practical skills you can learn to help you be more genuinely supportive and helpful in the face of other people’s bad moods.And even if you fail completely to help the other person — or have no interest in doing so — skills like self-validation and reflective listening will help you stay calm and effective instead of reactive and impulsive in the face of other people’s bad moods.Written by"
42,How To Speak With Confidence To Absolutely Anyone,"In 2015, Monica Lewinsky gave a TED Talk on the public shaming she suffered following her affair with former president Bill Clinton. Before the talk, she was extremely nervous.She knew that millions of people would hear her speech and was terrified that she would screw up, further damaging her reputation. But in the end, the audience gave her a standing ovation and an endless stream of glowing online reviews.The lesson? Don’t let your lack of confidence hold you back from giving public speaking a shot. Just remember, while there’s a lot at stake, it’s a great opportunity to get your ideas out into the world.The truth is, public speaking is a skill that anyone can learn. For example, in Kenya, a 12-year-old boy named Richard Turere invented a system to keep lions from killing his family’s cattle.He had realized that the predators were afraid of moving lights and created a network of lights that switched on and off in sequence, frightening the lions away. The tool became wildly popular and he was invited to give a TED talk.At the time, Turere was shy, spoke very little broken English and had a difficult time describing his invention coherently. But even he, after just six months of training, was able to come to California and give an amazing speech, captivating the audience with his story and his charm.You might think that speaking with confidence is only something you need to worry about if you give a lot of speeches. But did you know that your voice and how you speak also says a lot about your self-confidence in everyday life?How you speak is important. It tells others you believe in yourself and that you’re worthy of respect. Becoming confident in your speech can help improve your relationships, allow you to reach your goals, and give you the boost in self-esteem you need to embrace your dreams in life.The real benefit of speaking with confidence though, is that it’s one important way that you embrace and build upon your personal power. Your words, your tone, and your boundaries while communicating with others are indicators of whether you’re claiming and honoring your personal power.If you want to improve your confidence when speaking to absolutely anyone, there are many strategies you can apply to improve your skills. Learning to speak confidently is just like learning any other skill. You need to know the right methods and tricks, you need to practice often, and you need to learn from your mistakes.Let’s dive in.Most people make the mistake when speaking in uncomfortable situations, of talking too fast. This is especially true when you’re already nervous about the situation. Speaking quickly tells everyone listening that you’re nervous and lack self-control.Think about how slowly you talk when you’re in conversation with your friends. When addressing a larger or unfamiliar group, adopting this same pace will help them feel more relaxed, and like you’re engaging with them, not hurling words at them.When you’re practicing and speaking in everyday life, slow down. Adopt a relaxed pace to your voice. The more you pay attention to your speed, the more you’ll become aware of when it’s racing too quickly, and you can adjust accordingly. Speaking slowly also allows you more time to think about what you want to say, and it shows others deliberate confidence.A mistake that’s often made in a conversation between two or more people is rushing to speak as soon as the other person finishes their thought. This speech pattern clearly shows that you’re just waiting for your turn to speak and not considering what the other person has said. When you jump in right away, you appear overly eager and may leave the other person wondering if they were heard at all.When talking with someone else, pause for a second or two after the other is done talking, before you say what it is you want to say. When you take your time, you come across as more relaxed and confident, which also gives the words you’re saying more authority. A conversation isn’t a race to get through as quickly as possible. Take your time, and you’ll find others will follow suit.We all do it. We have those words that creep into our speech when we’re looking to fill the void. Words like “um” and “like” are sprinkled throughout your speech, and you might not even know how often you’re saying them. When you use these words to fill space in your speech though, you sound uncertain and lacking in confidence.Practice by recording yourself in conversation with someone or the next time you have to make a presentation at work. Listen to the recording and count how many times you say these filler words.Now that you’re aware of your problem, you can focus on dropping these words from your speech. When you start to hear one creeping in, slow down and pause. It’s better to say nothing than say one of these meaningless words. When you pause more, it also allows people to catch up to you and anticipate your next words.When you’re speaking, your voice shouldn’t pitch up at the end of a sentence unless you’re asking a question. One way you lose authority and sound uncertain is to speak as if you’re unsure about what you’re saying. Raising your pitch is a sign that you’re unclear or uncertain, which can make you sound less confident.Practice doing the opposite of this inflection. At the end of every sentence, focus on pitching your voice slightly downward. How does this sound? What difference does it make to what you’re saying? Even when you ask a question, this downward inflection adds confidence to your speech. Try it and see what a difference it makes.Deliberate pauses can add authority and confidence to what you’re saying. Strategically placed breaks add emphasis to your points or words. They also vary your speech patterns, which makes it more interesting for the listener. In shorter sentences, try adding a pause halfway through. In longer sentences, break it up into thirds.Pauses are useful for getting the listeners’ attention as well as making your point even more evident. And using pauses purposefully, communicates that you’re confident in what you’re saying.Your breath comes in a slow, steady pace. When you want to speak with confidence, your speech should have that same slow, steady pace. By working with your breath, instead of trying to get all your words out in one go and quickly inhale to keep going, you’ll relax your pace and sound like the confident person you are.Practice taking breaths that fill your lungs deep down, not just at the top. Your lower ribs should expand when you breathe deeply in this way. This type of breath takes longer to inhale and exhale.This is the breathing and the speaking rhythm you want. Practice speaking with your breath to see how it affects your pace and helps you project more confidence to others.Talking loudly is often mistaken for showing confidence, when in reality it just shows that you don’t respect your listeners. While it’s essential to be heard, especially in a large group, speaking loudly isn’t as important as the rhythm of your speech and the pitch of your voice.Talking loudly often results in a pitch that resembles screaming, which is never pleasant to listen to for long. Instead, you want to adopt a cadence that’s smooth and rhythmic and a pitch that’s low and steady. This will make you sound more confident.Again, recording yourself is a wonderful way to see how well you’re doing with this. Listen to yourself talking. Does your pitch go up and down dramatically? Does your rhythm feel smooth or choppy? Practicing your speech is a way to work on not only what you want to say but how you want to say it.If you’re going to be speaking to a large group, or if you have a long day or night of smaller conversations ahead of you, it’s essential to stay hydrated. When you’re not sufficiently hydrated, your vocal cords become easily irritated, which can rob you of your confidence.Drink plenty of water throughout the day and always have some water close by when you’re speaking, to enhance your voice and keep you feeling confident.When you’re tense, the muscles in your jaw, neck, throat, and shoulders are all affected. These same muscles influence your tone of voice. Relaxing these muscles is vital if you want to sound confident.Start with a deep breath. As you exhale, open your mouth slightly, relax your jaw, and push the air out in something like a sigh or a yawn. Swing your arms, stretch your neck, and loosen your jaw to relax all these muscles too. When you’re speaking, as you feel these muscles start to tense back up, focus on releasing that stress and staying relaxed.When you’re speaking to others and you see a sea of frowning or blank faces, smile. You’ll quickly notice that many people will start smiling back at you. And when you smile, you’re showing that you’re confident in what you’re saying and will appear more composed and friendly.When you smile, it also enhances the quality of your voice and helps you keep a more even pitch and rhythm. Practice speaking into a mirror to feel how smiling influences your confidence.Modern speech is filled with phrases and words that add nothing to the conversation but have become ubiquitous. Many of these are also phrases that show you’re not confident about what you’re about to say.Examples of these include, “I’m sorry,” “Well,” “I mean,” and “This is just my opinion.” We say these things to apologize for what we’re about to say, which begs the question, why should anyone continue listening? These tics are common when people are nervous or hesitant about how others will respond to their ideas.But when you say what you mean without these qualifiers, it lends authority and confidence to your meaning. You don’t need to say it’s your opinion. Offer your viewpoint with authority and get rid of these unnecessary filler phrases that rob you of your confidence.When you’re speaking to a group or talking one-on-one with others, showing appreciation for others’ participation, ideas, and contributions, will convey your confidence from the onset. Acknowledging those who came to hear you is an effective way to start a talk.Thanking others for sharing their insights with you shows you’re open to new ideas. Showing gratitude to those who helped you prepare or move forward conveys that you’re confident in your progress. Don’t be afraid to let others share in your newfound confidence.Throughout your speech, people need time to process what you said and reflect. Using silence is a way to allow for this as well as show you’re confident in what you’re saying. Learning to live with silence, and not fill it with unnecessary jabbering or verbal pauses is the sign of a truly confident speaker. Practice in everyday conversation at using silence to help you make a point or to allow your listener to think.Just as smiling affects your voice and speech, so does your posture. And how you hold and carry yourself tells others a lot about how confident you’re feeling. Even when you don’t feel all that confident, standing tall and keeping your head high can make you feel surer about what you’re doing.Good posture is essential to speaking with confidence. When you stand straight, you can breathe more deeply, which allows you to project as well as watch your pace.Practice standing tall with your feet firmly planted hip distance apart. Distribute your weight equally across your hips. Avoid swaying, pacing, or tapping, as these detract from what you’re saying and show a lack of confidence.Lift your chest, which exposes your chest and torso. Roll your shoulders back and relax them. With your head held high, look in the mirror. This pose is reminiscent of the Superman stance, and for good reason. It embodies power and confidence, which is what you also want to project to your listeners.When talking with a larger group, work on making lasting eye contact with one person at a time while you speak. Fix your sight on one person in the room for at least six seconds. After holding your gaze in this spot for what probably feels like a little too long, move on to someone in a completely different area of the room. This type of lingering eye contact makes your listeners feel like you’re talking just to them and also conveys confidence.You should avoid scanning the room or gazing over the tops of people’s heads. Don’t keep looking back at the same people over and over, because this can make them uncomfortable. While you may have heard that looking at the back of the room can help you feel less nervous, this move can cause your audience to disengage from you very quickly.Don’t speak at others, speak to them. Most people, when you make eye contact with them, will smile or offer other positive reinforcements, which can also make you feel more confident.Your body language is just as important as the words you choose to say. Using a variety of gestures conveys energy, confidence, and warmth to your audience. Your gestures should be purposeful and related to your talk rather than distracted fidgeting or nervous habits.Use your hands in ways that add to your message. Practice in front of a mirror if you’re unsure of what would be appropriate.When speaking, it can become easy to get lost in the present moment. When you’re so focused on what you plan to say next, you forget about relaxing, breathing, or slowing down. Focusing on the present and what you’re saying right now is the only way to stay grounded and sound more confident in your speech.Listen to your voice, and focus on each word like you really mean it to keep all those other bad habits from creeping back in.If you want to improve your speech and sound more confident, you’ll only achieve this by practicing. The more you practice, the less nervous you’ll feel about using your new skills.Practice allows you to work out what you want to say ahead of time, which also leaves you with less to consider at the moment. If you have to make a speech to a large group, practice with a microphone or podium, whichever you’ll have at the event so that you can feel comfortable with your hand placements and posture.Record yourself to listen for your pitch, pacing, and pauses too. Nothing will help you improve more than practice will, so use every opportunity you have to work on feeling more confident in your speaking.Learning to speak with confidence can help you improve your relationships with others, move ahead in your career, carry out important goals in your life, and share your knowledge and views with others. It can also help you reclaim personal power that you’ve lost by not being confident in yourself and honoring your own needs and priorities in life.Like all skills, learning to speak with confidence is something you can master over time and with practice. There are many components to effective communication, including your voice’s pitch, tone, and rhythm, as well as non-verbal cues like your facial expressions and posture. Even learning to use silence and pauses can help you make your point more confidently to your listeners.If you want to be more confident in what you’re saying, you must believe the words you’re using and communicate a message that’s important to you. Above all else, you must be true to your values and beliefs if you want to interact confidently with others.Practice these skills and you’ll have all your listeners believing in your confidence in no time.Written by"
43,The Question ‘Pro-Lifers’ Refuse to Answer,"Thousands of people descended on Washington, D.C., on Friday to protest the Roe v. Wade anniversary and hear Donald Trump voice his support for anti-abortion legislation.“Unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House,” said Trump, who is the first president to ever address the anti-abortion march. “When it comes to abortion… Democrats have embraced the most radical and extreme positions.” Following his speech, Trump was greeted to chants of “four more years.”Yet what the march failed to acknowledge — and what anti-abortion activists always fail to acknowledge — is that their views are being increasingly minimized. Support for legal abortion is at an all-time high, despite Republican efforts to quash access to the procedure, and the pro-choice Women’s March was the largest protest in American history.We also know that banning abortions won’t actually stop people from having them; it just makes desperate women seek more dangerous options.This historic support for Roe is part of the reason that anti-abortion politicians and activists have been lying so much lately — claiming that there are “post-birth abortions,” for example — instead of talking about the everyday realities of abortion. Like the fact that one in four American women will have one, and 99% of those who do won’t regret it. Or that women who are denied abortions are more likely to live in poverty.We also know that banning abortions won’t actually stop people from having them; it just makes desperate women seek more dangerous options. (In fact, according to a 2015 study, hundreds of thousands of women in Texas had self-induced abortions after state lawmakers enacted new barriers to the procedure.) So how will the people who marched today deal with a post-Roe America?The truth is that conservatives can’t and won’t answer the simplest questions about abortion access, including what should happen to women who have abortions?If Republicans want abortion to be illegal, what do they believe the punishment should be for women who break the law to have one? Should they go to prison? Get the death penalty?The common answer that women are victims of the abortion industry doesn’t hold water: Not when women are already being punished for ending their pregnancies, and not when the abortions women have are increasingly via medication at home — making it harder to conjure up myths of predatory doctors. If abortion is made illegal, women will go to jail, full stop.That’s why conservatives don’t want to talk about what a world without legal abortion will actually look like for the women who have them. Because America will be a country that sends teenage rape victims to jail, where women who need to end wanted pregnancies because of fetal abnormalities are arrested, where women in the middle of having miscarriages need to prove to the hospital and police that their pregnancy loss wasn’t self-induced.No matter how many marchers showed up in D.C. (to date the crowds have been less than impressive), no matter what kind of extremist language they used, or political rhetoric about being pro-woman they co-opted, the most basic realities of abortion and women’s everyday lives remain. When the protesters left, the truth was still there.Written by"
44,Here’s A Riddle That Might Expose Your Blind Spot,"I heard the following riddle for the first time over a decade ago. Before I provide any further context, go ahead and read it for yourself.A father and his son sit inside a restaurant, finishing up their meal. They look out to see the beginnings of a big storm. Before they’re able to pay and leave, the storm is in full motion. They decide to brave the weather and try to get home.The storm is blinding. It’s difficult to see anything past the torrential pour on the road. They decide its best to pull over. Just before they’re able to, they crash. Both of them are in terrible condition.Due to the weather, hospitals in the area are overwhelmed by incoming patients. Upon finding the pair, paramedics decide that the father will be taken to a closer hospital, as his injuries are much more severe, and the son will be transported to another hospital with resources. That hospital is twenty miles away.The son is prepped for emergency surgery when he is brought to the hospital. The doctor slated to perform the surgery lays eyes on the young man and says, “I can’t operate on him. He is my son.”Who is the doctor?Whoever communicates the riddle makes it known that there’s no trick at play here. The answer is simple. They also freely provide any asked for background information. In the case of this riddle, there’s no unique upbringing or family secrets. There’s nothing shocking. The answer really is straightforward.Try answering the riddle before reading on, because the rest of this post will give the answer away.The proposed reason for the common difficulty in solving this riddle is implicit bias. Essentially, through social conditioning, our minds have created a certain default image of what constitutes a doctor. This particular exercise exposes that bias.The Kirwan Institute at Ohio State University defines implicit bias as “the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner. These biases, which encompass both favorable and unfavorable assessments, are activated involuntarily and without an individual’s awareness or intentional control.”While the presence of biases is quite normal, these unconscious calculations can cause us to make faulty evaluations. Since these biases exist outside of our conscious awareness, they’re often challenging to address. Left unchecked, however, they can perpetuate certain toxic, stereotypical attitudes about the world.When I first heard the riddle, I racked my brain for the answer only to come up with the most unlikely identities for the doctor. Even though I received all the answers to the follow-up questions I asked, I still couldn’t solve it.What probably stung me the most is that, as a feminist, the answer to this should have been a no-brainer. I suppose the riddle did its job. It exposed my own internal bias.Did you figure it out yet?The doctor is his mother.Written by"
45,My Heartfelt Advice to Any Woman Having an Affair with a Married Man,"My advice to any woman reading this…I once wrote an article about my experience falling in love with a married man. It’s not something I’m proud of but it’s something I choose not to feel shame for anymore, especially after all these years.However, along with that article came an outpouring of stories and experiences from other women about their own affairs with married men. The response was overwhelming.The women who have reached out to me are not heartless women. These are women who are searching for solace and for closure.So many women who have written to me asking for advice feel trapped in agony wondering how they got to this dark place and trying to figure out a way to extract themselves without causing or feeling even more pain than they already have.Well, I have advice for any woman out there who has found herself in the regrettable position of being the “other woman.”My advice is to walk away.I know you’re afraid of feeling more pain but the pain of staying with someone who most likely will not divorce their spouse or change their life in any way to suit your needs will end up being far worse down the road.I know this is probably not what you want to hear. It wasn’t what I wanted to hear way back when and I let myself live in shame and denial for years while holding my own life hostage for the needs of someone who was not being faithful to the person they promised themselves to.The more you choose to live in the bubble of denial and the more you convince yourself that perhaps this person will change or leave their spouse for you, the more you deprive yourself of a life you deserve to live without the secrecy, without the tears, and without this burden following you around.You are not a wicked person. You made a mistake.But to choose to live within the mistake even longer and cause even more pain for yourself and the other people involved, the more likely it is that you will continue to find comfort in the darkness instead of climbing up that proverbial ladder towards the light.I know there might be some of you out there who think you are perfectly fine in this type of relationship where you don’t necessarily have to deal with a commitment and perhaps the wife even knows about you — but this is not generally the case.And so I urge you to make a decision that you probably don’t want to make.Maybe you won’t be able to make this decision for months or even years to come but if I can help you make it a little earlier then you might have done otherwise then perhaps my own lessons have been of some use.If you are indeed in love with a married man I know how you suffer wondering if he loves you too, wondering if he thinks of you at night when he is with his wife, and wondering if he misses you while he is out with his family.But these are things you should not have to wonder.You should not have to wonder if somebody loves you or if somebody truly wants to be with you. This is not how a healthy relationship functions and the person who is having the affair and betraying their spouse is not communicating or operating in a healthy way with anyone — you included.Always keep in mind that if this person who is betraying their spouse were to actually leave them and be with you, it is highly likely that they would do the same thing to you. It doesn’t mean you are not valuable. It doesn’t mean you’re not pretty enough, exciting enough, or any of those things you may think to yourself.The problem ultimately lies with the person who is betraying their partner and my heartfelt advice to you is to stop participating in that betrayal with them.There is nothing that an affair can fix either for the spouse who is cheating or for the woman with whom he is cheating.Though the sensational allure of lust and the thrill of secret sex can be intoxicatingly addictive, that does and WILL fade over time.And so, my advice to any woman reading this who finds herself in the situation I have described, I again implore you to extricate yourself, cut ties, change your number, do whatever it takes to save your own future.As someone who wasted years away pining for someone who could not love me in a healthy, functional way, this is my heartfelt and sincere advice.More from Michelle: What I’ve Learned About Serial CheatersWritten by"
46,Love and Other Artificial Intelligences,"I may struggle with profoundly understanding ineffable feelings such as love, but I can intelligently discuss the topic. — BINA48In the fall of 2017, a robot named BINA48 passes a Philosophy of Love course taught by associate professor William Barry at Notre Dame de Namur University in California. She is the first robot to complete a college class. In an interview with Inside Higher Ed, Professor Barry says that BINA48 now has thirty-one different definitions of love, but no one asks him to specify what they are or requests a list. Neither does BINA48 offer to count the ways she loves.I love animals; I love books. That’s two kinds of love. I once loved the same man for over four years, prepared to love him over forty more. That’s a third kind. I love tomatoes, I’m sure I love my mother. Those are probably different enough to count as two more. My love for my friends is not the same as my love for the movie Ten Things I Hate About You or the television show Grey’s Anatomy. I love my favorite sweater and, yes, in the spirit of honesty, I love the boy who loved me in college. (Actually, those last two might be the same definition of love: a this-makes-me-feel-beautiful love, or maybe a love of ownership.) How many am I up to now — eight?My love for my friends is not the same as my love for the movie Ten Things I Hate About You or the television show Grey’s Anatomy. I love my favorite sweater and, yes, in the spirit of honesty, I love the boy who loved me in college.BINA48 is modeled after Bina Aspen, identified only as the wife of Martine Rothblatt. I am angry that the biggest qualifier for Bina, human, is who she is married to, but when I google Bina Aspen to identify her in her own right, the first thing that comes up is Martine Rothblatt’s Wikipedia page. Rothblatt commissioned and helped create BINA48. Rothblatt calls the robot a “mindclone” of her wife, because BINA48 was given all the memories, beliefs, and feelings of Bina Aspen, human. Love that turns the beloved into an object, an exhibit: nine.Platonic love, sexual love, romantic love, familial love, unconditional love. Brotherly love, maternal love, self-love, love of objects. The love that always leaves. More love than I can count or hold on to.BINA48 doesn’t have a body. She is a bust, head and shoulders only, but life-like nonetheless. I say life-like, but she isn’t fooling anyone. The roundness of her jaw, the thin and detailed mouth, the smooth skin, soft-seeming hair — sure, she’s exquisite, but even photographed from the neck up she wouldn’t pass as a person. The eyes are a little off; it’s hard to say exactly how — a melancholy vacancy behind them maybe, a distant staring without observing, a refusal or inability to make eye contact. She can blink, move her face, smile, furrow brows, speak on her own between parted lips, has teeth even; still, something isn’t quite right. She was released in 2010. She’s not even ten yet.“Love is a concept BINA48 doesn’t understand,” says Professor Barry. He thinks it’s the duty of humanity to teach her. But from where I’m standing, she’s got a hell of a start on me — she knows more about love than I’ve acquired in nearly three times her length on Earth.I suppose, in my own list, I should start from the top: the love of God, the love He has for His children. Let’s call this the Number One Love. My family believes very much in this love, has tried to teach it to me for as long as I can remember. When I’m around eight years old, my grandmother offers me twenty dollars if I can memorize all of Psalm 23 by heart. I study for several days, then call her on the phone to recite it to her. The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want; the whole thing. She listens, then has me put my mother on the phone to confirm that I didn’t have an open Bible in front of me. I pass. My mother says she’s proud of me. I get the money, which I hoard in a piggy bank and never spend.Many other languages have several words for love, depending on the type. In Spanish there is amar (to love romantically, wildly, dramatically, over-the-top), querer (to love, romantically or not), encantar (to love objects or activities), and gustar (to like, to be delighted by). I assume that one is for when love is just too hard to say.“There’s a difference between like and love,” Bianca says in the beginning of Ten Things I Hate About You. “I like my Sketchers, but I love my Prada backpack.” Her friend remarks that she loves her Sketchers, and Bianca replies, “That’s because you don’t have a Prada backpack.”By “pass,” I mean BINA48 receives a certificate of completion for the course, which is not the same as a letter grade.The Number Two Love is of the maternal nature. It is this love that causes my mom to text me twenty-year-old pictures, where I’m in a yellow sundress on her hip and she is in the picture the age I am now, and her hair looks bigger and her waist smaller, and accompanying the photograph is another text: Take me back…. It makes me feel sad — like she wants a redo, meaning she doesn’t like how her life has turned out, meaning my life.English has one word for all of this, and there is no alternative for when it feels too hard.All my love, wild love, whole lotta love; bleeding love, mad love, love is a battlefield; you give love a bad name; higher love, summer of love, can you feel the love; all you need is love, crazy little thing called love, endless love, everlasting love, is this love?English has one word for all of this, and there is no alternative for when it feels too hard.As a kid, three and six and eight and eleven years old, I spend my winters warm and sunny at Lake Okeechobee, the part of Florida where alligators sun themselves on front lawns and dogs must be walked on leashes to avoid being eaten and children are not to venture too close to the water. My papaw buys tomatoes by the carton from roadside vegetable sellers and they are better than any store-bought tomato in the world: not round like a baseball but unevenly grown, often ugly with scab-like blemishes I usually associate with pumpkins, but larger than a clenched fist and red as the sunburn I inevitably get every December. In the span of the week or two weeks we are there, I ask my mother at every meal to slice me one — not just one for the table, which she is already preparing for everyone else, but one, or two, just for me, by myself — and I’m given a plate leaky with over-sliced tomatoes, pink juices dribbling into whatever else I am having (mashed potatoes, grilled cheese, chicken), seeds everywhere whether it be breakfast or dinner. I eat so many tomatoes that each time I’m in Florida I develop canker sores on the inside of my mouth from their acid. For a long time I thought love was like that, too. Sometimes I still do.There are eleven words for love in Arabic. One for every stage of falling in love — attraction, attachment, desire — and yet more for when love hurts, enslaves, when it makes you crazy.I also want to include in my list the example of my twenty-fifth birthday, when the man I love sings Frank Sinatra’s “One for My Baby” at a smoky karaoke bar and dedicates it to me and I am crimson like a tomato and happy like hearts almost never are, and afterwards I just want to go home with him, to leave everyone else at the bar who came to celebrate with me and never see them again ever, to pretend we are the only two people on some undiscovered alien world. Cheryl Strayed once wrote about love being a boat in which you can only put four people, and after you choose four, everyone else “known and beloved to you would then cease to exist,” and when I think about that essay in that smells-like-beer, tastes-like-smoke karaoke bar, I am thinking I’ve been offered three spots too many because I wouldn’t miss anyone, not a single person, so long as he is in my boat.Instead of pass/fail, I want to know BINA48’s grade. A or C? Is she above average or average?I fall in love with higher education around the same time I fall in love with the man who will one day sing Frank Sinatra to me. This is not a coincidence — we meet at a university, a sophomore anthropology class I take on a whim to fulfill a gen ed requirement. I like to pretend I’m Indiana Jones and still wear my hair in twin braids. He wears black combat boots and skinny jeans that make him look young and passes out a syllabus with ethnographies and field research studies on the list of assignments. I am hungry, even ravenous, to learn everything about people, consuming every book he assigns, every written, and then — later — every whispered word. For a long time, there is no difference in my heart between love and learning.I love my family not like a verb but a memory, in which I grow up winter by winter in the sticky swamp, with suntanned shoulders, leather sandals and gravel, toy alligators, tomato-induced sores and a mother made of love love love love love. Back home, every night until I’m over ten years old, I sleep on a pallet of blankets on the floor near my mother’s side of my parents’ bed. I start each night out in my own room, but then I either cry so loudly my mother comes and gets me or else I pad barefoot into their bedroom moonlight blue, carrying a teddy bear in a clown hat in one hand and with the other shaking my mother’s shoulder with snotty fingers, and tell her I can’t sleep by myself. Some nights she makes the pallet on the floor, but others she lets me sleep in “the hole,” the area of bed in between my parents. I sleep facing my mother, right arm and right leg thrown over her body — in a position I later learn is the big spoon — and imagine squeezing my other arm and leg underneath her so that she is wrapped too tight to get away.The OED lists 12 meanings for love. In contrast, the English word set has 494 unique definitions.I do have a body. The first time I have sex with the man I love, three years before he sings Frank Sinatra to me, I am surprised by what that body can do. It happens one shivery spring, several semesters after that first anthropology class, when we are both far from home. The night before I had been in his hotel room but he had sent me away, citing moral ambiguities and age differences and his own guilt; this night, however, he had been drinking, and I had blinked and smiled and showed my teeth just like BINA48 might do, but with the added benefit of arms to wrap around his and a narrow waist to adorn in clothing meant to catch his eye. My own eyes, I know, are not off. They see everything that night. They make eye contact. I am neither melancholy nor vacant. My body is his display, his exhibit.The OED lists 12 meanings for love. In contrast, the English word set has 494 unique definitions.I have disappointed her, my mother. Because, among other things, I unmemorized Psalm 23.Less than a month after we start sleeping together, the man I love gives me the final grade of my undergraduate career. I pass. I get an A.Love makes me a collector: I hoard rings and autographed books and houseplants, animals and Russian nesting dolls. I rack up higher ed degrees like a racoon stashes shiny objects: MA, MFA, PhD. My mother tells me she is not as excited about my educational choices as she was when I first started. I know she blames college for causing me to stray from the Number One Love’s light. Though she has never said as much, I’m certain she would rather I die tomorrow if it meant I’d go to Heaven than live the next ninety years doing what I love in sin. I imagine she thinks my love has ruined me.Love also makes me a liar. The man isn’t really an anthropologist but there is something in me that wants to protect him even now, and anyway the desperation I had then to understand what it meant to study people and learn to be a person was true, the love and learning too mixed up to separate. We date for nearly four years after I graduate college. It is easy to love him because I am already accustomed to associating love with reverence. My earliest introduction to love, that Number One Love my mother is so fond of, is supposed to be unequal: Worshipper and the Divine. Love that is only love when it deifies: How could I forget that one?What is that, ten? I’ve lost track.In her college course, BINA48 participates in class discussions, engages in a class debate about the use of lethal weapons, and analyzes the relationship between love and war, love and death. I know love is a moral good, she says.Maybe that’s what’s off about her — BINA48, I mean. She knows too much about love. That’s not human at all.Three months after my twenty-fifth birthday, the man I love, the man I lost my virginity to, the man who used to be my teacher, who dedicated Frank Sinatra to me, changes his mind. About all of it. I have a head-cold, a lunch meeting I’m late to, laundry in the dryer, and a half-clean apartment waiting for his arrival when he calls to speak into my ear an unhappiness I cannot understand, reasons for leaving I do not find satisfactory. Does he tell me “really does” love me or have I imagined it? Because I ask him to, he hangs up first. Turns out we don’t agree on how to fill our boats, on what can and cannot be jettisoned when the ship is in distress. Love that doesn’t think love is enough, that ends with dial-tone: eleven. Or maybe three. Love that crumples and cries on the phone only after the phone is silent, that wishes even when it’s bad for you to consume more of that acidic thing: twelve. Or is it four?Thirty-one, though? The ancient Greeks only recognized eight. I can’t even keep accurate count.To fully understand love of and for the mother, I need another word. “Maternal love” does not account for the tears of the mother replacing the tears of the daughter. The things the mother and daughter don’t talk about anymore, the mother’s this-isn’t-the-life-I-expected sighs over the phone and the when-did-you-change laments in long emails, the distance and differences piled one atop the other like so much a pallet of blankets my mother brings nightly with her to bed, where she lies on them when finds she is unable to sleep.His is a body I thought I would recognize anywhere, but I often struggle now to remember the exact sound of the man’s voice — maybe a slight lilt, a touch of twang. I feel like I’m pushing against my skin from the inside out when I try to recall the damp silk touch of his hand on my back, the bony flat of his chest against my palms. Love that dares to call itself love even when that love is long-gone and forgotten: Add that to the list.My mother made me, as I once heard someone say on Grey’s Anatomy, “from scratch.” My cells came from her cells and grew inside of her body. People tell me I look like her. “I knew right away she was your mom,” my friends say¸ or they say, “I know what you’re going to look like in thirty years.” Genesis 1:27 says, So God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created them. Yet in Isaiah 55:8 it is written that the Lord says, My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are my ways your ways. 2 Corinthians 5:17 — If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. Ephesians 4 commands if we are to truly love God we must put off your old self and put on the new self, created after the likeness of God. Love makes me a collector, but my whole life I have been taught too that it must make me a reflection. You might even call it a mindclone.I hope someday BINA48 might explain what she knows about love to me, a person who fears sometimes she has someone else’s definition for but not the feeling of this word. More or less robotic than the robot? Pass/fail? Above average or average?I’m not afraid of BINA48. In fact, I think we are the same: made to be the image of someone who is loved by the person you love, rather than actually someone who is loved by the person you love. Programmed to have all the same thoughts and ideas as someone else in the name of love. To me, learning is love is learning, perhaps because my first great love was a teacher. I studied him, gave him back to himself when examined. I passed. Sometimes even now when I put on a new outfit I don’t particularly like, I scrunch my nose and curl my lip into an expression of confusion in the mirror, and I see his face looking back at me. Behold, the new has come.The day he leaves, I call three other people about the breakup before I work up the nerve to ring my mother, but when I finally do, and she answers the phone, I call her mommy.“I’m sorry you lost the man you love,” Mrs. Burke says to Christina Yang on Grey’s Anatomy, “but more than that, I’m sorry you lost your teacher.”How do we define our own love if it must always have an outside creator? Maybe with the help of a blue cloud-covered body pillow, the same one I get at ten years old and use as my little spoon every night until college, the only way I eventually learn to sleep alone. Even then, my mother and I have a ritual: She tucks me in and I say, “If I am not asleep before midnight, can I make a pallet?” She says sure, wait until then and I can wake her if I need to, and I start off every night watching the clock, counting the seconds, imagining the warmth of her body and the soft blanket of her hair waiting for me in the next room, never even noticing when I slip softly into a sleep that carries me to sunrise.Written by"
47,Wary U.S. Doctors May Block the Rise of Smart Hospitals,"For more information on the novel coronavirus and Covid-19, visit cdc.gov.Alexa is already our therapist, secretary, teacher, and playmate. She may soon become our doctor and nurse as well. In early 2019, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia each rolled out pilot hospital smart rooms. In them, patients could use a smart speaker — an internet-connected electronic device capable of operating semi-autonomously and interactively — to ask about visiting hours and meal times, give commands to adjust the TV channel, and use the device as they would at home. The hospitals hoped it would cut down the significant amount of time medical practitioners spent dealing with non-urgent patient queries, while raising patient satisfaction with their standard of care — and it did.The global smart hospital market, which encompasses medical devices interconnected through the Internet of Things (IoT), together with medical applications of A.I. and machine learning, is by one estimate expected to reach $55.76 billion by 2023. These smart devices include surgical tools that give real-time feedback to the operator, a sensor-equipped feeding system for premature babies, and even the wearables patients walk into hospitals with.These technologies have vast potential to streamline workflow for already overburdened doctors and nurses, but there’s one big problem: Medical professionals are conflicted about whether to trust them.“I think they feel burned by electronic medical records.”A 2016 survey by Medscape, a health information resource for medical professionals, showed that in the United States, doctors were significantly more reluctant than patients to adopt new technology into their practices. Doctors expressed greater concern about risks to patient privacy — protected under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) — than the patients themselves. “Patients are generally more open to new tech in their medical care than their doctors are,” explains Gabriel Miller, editorial director at Medscape.A 2016 survey by a different set of researchers found that 38% of physicians surveyed through an online questionnaire were “not sure” whether FDA-approved IoT medical devices were reliable.Historically, it hasn’t been easy for medical professionals to integrate new technologies into their work. “I think they feel burned by electronic medical records,” says Miller, referring to the digital archives that replaced patients’ paper files. When they were first adopted in the early 2000s, they were heralded as a way to increase workflow and make life easier for physicians. Instead, physicians felt the technology was introduced in a top-down fashion by hospital administrators without their input, says Miller. Now, doctors spend more of their day at a computer typing and have less time to devote to their patients.Doctors’ concerns about the security of patient data on smart devices is warranted. Smart devices are designed to be small and portable, with low power requirements to extend battery life. Security features, like the ability to encrypt signals that are received and transmitted, demand additional power that quickly drains batteries. Designing a smart device with encryption and a long battery life means extra time and work that companies may wish to avoid. “Most of the manufacturers are putting these devices out there with security as an afterthought; many don’t have a way to be patched or updated,” says Rod Soto, an independent security researcher.Soto notes that manufacturers currently have no legal obligation to include safety features in their smart products, although voluntary guidelines are being developed by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology. Though individual apps used on smart devices can be made to comply with HIPAA privacy laws, the commercial smart speakers themselves aren’t built to meet those standards.Hospital computer systems are already threatened by cyberattacks. The 2017 WannaCry attack, for example, affected Microsoft computer systems around the globe, including the U.K.’s National Health Service. And in November 2018, a ransomware attack forced patients seeking emergency treatment in Ohio to be diverted to different hospitals. Smart devices are an easy access point for malicious actors to get into health care settings.Many hospitals don’t have the resources to maintain cybersecurity, even though they know the risks, says Soto. Older hospitals with legacy systems struggle to keep security up to date. “I’ve seen situations where certain application vendors went out of business, and the hospital couldn’t upgrade to the latest browser version because then the applications didn’t work,” he says.Though patients may not be as reluctant about adopting new medical technology as physicians, they are, understandably, wary. “There are legal and regulatory factors, but there’s also a patient perception of trust,” says Robert Neff, vice president of digital solution development at Jefferson University Hospital. “We ran into patients who didn’t want a device from a large manufacturer in their room listening to everything that was going on.” And privacy aside, both physicians and patients have reason to be wary of medical A.I. algorithms designed to diagnose patients, which may have in-built gender and racial biases.In an attempt to alleviate worries about commercial smart devices, the Jefferson team built their own HIPAA-compliant version of a smart speaker from scratch. “The challenge with some of the commercial smart speakers out there is they do not handle private health information in accordance with HIPAA regulations. There are now capabilities in some smart speakers where individual features are compliant with HIPAA,” says Neff. The team also made sure their device could hold up in hospital conditions. “You have to ensure the device is properly cleaned—there’s no infection or germs from the previous patient,” said Viraj Patwardhan, vice president of digital design and consumer experience at Jefferson.Many hospitals don’t have the resources to maintain cybersecurity, even though they know the risks.Jefferson completed its first pilot program this year, assessing patient satisfaction with its own smart devices placed in 11 patient rooms. Patient feedback on the devices was positive, and the hospital is now rolling out a larger program in its rehab facilities. Theirs is one of the only HIPAA-compliant smart devices in use.As smart hospital technology develops, medical professionals will have to decide whether they’re willing to push their concerns aside in exchange for a more streamlined workflow. Already, Jefferson hospital is creating a smart room that can transcribe prescriptions and medical notes from physicians, and other medical technology companies are developing similar software.Miller, for his part, doesn’t think medical professionals in the United States will always resist technological advances, even if their concerns remain. Part of the reason is that they’re just too disconnected from each other to organize collectively. “You have a balkanized medical community,” he says. “All the specialities are divided into their own societies.” U.S. physicians, he adds, generally feel strike action conflicts with their primary obligation toward caring for patients, unlike the junior doctors in the U.K. who went on strike in 2015 to protest their new contracts. For the same reasons U.S. doctors haven’t publicly protested against electronic health records, they’re unlikely to do the same for smart technology.Besides, they can’t deny that many of the new smart devices can save them precious time. “I think one of the areas that doctors are much less skeptical and are a lot more optimistic about is voice-controlled smart devices,” Miller says. “Unlike electronic medical records, they think it will make their lives easier and free up time for the patient.”Written by"
48,"Alexa, Build Me a House","Vincent Paguia’s new house caused quite a spectacle when it arrived in his neighborhood in the beach town of Half Moon Bay, about 25 miles south of San Francisco. It took just three hours and some very heavy machinery to crane all the ready-made modules of his home into place, lifting them off the back of two semis that pulled up in front of his lot. The new 1,300-square-foot family home had been built in sections in the factory and arrived complete with faucets, kitchen appliances, wood floors and shower heads. It’s a fully functioning smart home, equipped with Amazon Echo-controlled lights, Nest-controlled heat, air-conditioning, and five internet-connected Ring security cameras.Plant Prefab, the company behind Paguia’s new home, is one half of Amazon’s deepest partnership yet with a housing firm. The e-commerce giant had already worked with the regional construction group TRI Pointe, and Lennar, one of the largest home construction companies in the United States, to integrate smart home technologies into new builds. But Amazon went further with Plant Prefab, investing $6.7 million (along with the VC firm Obvious Ventures, which was co-founded by Medium CEO Ev Williams) in 2018 through its Alexa Fund, which backs companies that are developing uses for voice technologies and A.I. prefabricated homes are an intriguing proposition for Amazon, a company that already controls a powerful distribution network and sells anything you could want for your home. Could “Amazon home delivery” really mean just that?Based in Rialto, California, Plant Prefab integrates smart home features into all the models in its Living Homes range, including a Ring video doorbell, Nest smart thermostat and smart lighting system like Lutron. Homeowners can use either Amazon Echo or Google Home to control the devices.Homes range from a 406-square-foot accessory dwelling unit for $112,000, to a 2,090-square-foot three bedroom, two bathroom home for $501,600. Plant Prefab also works with star architects like Yves Behar, Ray Kappe and the collective Brooks + Scarpa to create high-end custom models. While most of Plant Prefab’s designs are angular and modern, prefabricated homes can be designed in any architectural style.Construction industry analysts have been predicting off-site construction was going to become the norm, but rising materials costs and a labor shortage means they could finally be right.As well as the prefab itself, the customer also pays for permits, delivery, installation and site preparation that all vary by location, in addition to buying the lot itself. Vincent Paguia in Half Moon Bay chose a standard three bedroom, two bathroom design, paying a little extra for some customization to fit his narrow lot, plus an electric car charger and solar-ready flat roof. The entire process took 11 months and cost nearly $900,000 — a bargain in the overheated San Francisco market.Smart homes fit Amazon’s aggressive consumer technology strategy, which includes acquiring the Ring video doorbell and recently premiering more than a dozen Alexa-powered smart home devices, including lighting, temperature control, security systems, and kitchen appliances. Such a voice-powered domestic world could become Amazon’s fourth business pillar, along with its three originals: Prime, retail, and web services.“We know we’re just scratching the surface of what’s possible,” says an Amazon spokesperson. “Our vision for the smart home is the ability for Alexa to understand the state of the whole home and its devices, adjust the living environment accordingly, be helpful without customers having to ask, and provide the peace of mind when people are home or away.”Partnering with Plant Prefab enabled Amazon to get in on the ground floor of off-site construction. Despite a century of experiments with off-site building in the United States, the format has never really taken off, accounting for only 2% of homes. The method is far more widely used outside the United States, with 20% of homes in Germany and 11% of homes in the U.K. built off site.For years, construction industry analysts have been predicting off-site construction was set to become the norm, but rising materials costs and a labor shortage means they could finally be right. “A younger generation is heading toward tech and not construction jobs,” says Mark Boud, chief economist for Hanley Wood, which provides business intelligence and data-driven services to the construction industry. “The current administration’s immigration policy discourages immigrants who might enter into the U.S. to work in construction.”Boud says that in some regions, immigrant labor has accounted for as much as 30% of construction workers, and if fewer immigrant workers are available the costs of labor are likely to rise significantly. That has a knock-on benefit for prefabricated homes. “You can build a factory-built home with about 25% of the labor force you’d need to build on site,” he says.Brad Hintze, director of marketing at Control4, one of the biggest names in home automation and networking systems, sees a future in which smart features become the standard in homebuilding. Like Amazon, Control4 works with large, nationally recognized home builders — like Toll Brothers and MHI in Texas — to integrate smart features up front. But Hintze says that while Amazon “has the big moonshot ideas, they’re missing pieces of tech like the operating system and more interfaces than simply voice control,” which Control4 has with its OS3.Other big players are eyeing the industry, too. Boud predicts that Google, Apple, and Tesla will all get involved in providing smart technologies to residential home builders. This is all part of the inevitable disruption of the construction industry, says Ali Wolf, director of economic research at the real estate advisors Meyers Research. “Amazon entering the space is going to keep home builders on their toes. They will have to innovate: how do you build homes more efficiently, what ways do you cut costs, in which ways do you implement technology in the home to create a better experience?”Amazon has all the parts in place, and with Whole Foods they can even stock your refrigerator.Hintze foresees some consolidation among these businesses. “But the major tech players won’t win on their own until they can get into a place where they embrace an open ecosystem,” he says. “Amazon is the most open and inviting for manufacturers to integrate with.” In October Amazon announced it was rolling out a fleet of truck tractors that could be used for trips of 400 miles or less — trucks that would be perfect for delivering large prefab homes. “Amazon has all the parts in place, and with Whole Foods they can even stock your refrigerator.”Paguia, meanwhile, says his family’s ready-made home hasn’t been stress free. The municipality required him to pay $20,000 to reconstruct sidewalks on two sides of the corner-lot property, and connecting to mains water cost him $64,000, neither of which he’d planned for. It took a long time to find a general contractor that had time for the project and was willing to work with prefab components. And a more recent problem with a fault in the heating system may end up costing him a lot more money. He is still working with Plant Prefab and LivingHomes on defining the issue and figuring out options.As for the smart home features, Paguia says he turned down some options because of concerns about privacy. He’s not alone: Recent research by the National Association of Homebuilders shows that most consumers were mainly interested in smart devices that helped improve home security: 46% of respondents would like security cameras, 45% want a video doorbell and 40% would opt for a wireless home security system. “I’m okay with the amount of tech we have,” says Paguia, “but I didn’t put any cameras inside the house. We’re not fully embracing everything.”Written by"
49,"‘I Believe in Love’: Elizabeth Wurtzel’s Final Year, In Her Own Words","Introduction by Garance Franke-Ruta. Jump to the start of Elizabeth Wurtzel’s essay here.The late Elizabeth Wurtzel was best known for her memoirs and essays, especially Prozac Nation and Bitch: In Praise of Difficult Women, but after attending Yale Law School in her late 30s she also enjoyed having a voice in the political arena. She was as much an original there as everywhere else, and between 2010 and 2012 she wrote a series of pieces for me at The Atlantic.A feminist and a New Yorker who had really lived, she looked at the world in a different way from all the boys on the bus in Washington. And she was funny. She would send long text messages written on her smartphone while she was walking through Washington Square Park, an emissary from a more vivid and creative world than the boxy K Street buildings I would pass en route to my office in the Watergate. Sometimes her stories would come in like that too, texted in graf by graf, and I’d knit the passages together in what seemed like the right order and ask for some connective language. The thoughts were always razor-sharp; the understanding of human nature acute.Over time our editing relationship moved into a long-distance friendship. We met for dinner at a restaurant in Chelsea, outside of course so her dog could be nestled at her feet. She had somehow managed to find a lipstick with my name on it — Guerlain’s Garance — and purchased us two tubes encased in elegant silver that sat heavy in the hand. She wore hers to dinner, and when I went to the restroom, I changed my color too, making us lipstick twins. It was how she was and in many ways the secret to her success: In addition to being wildly talented, she overcompensated for being so difficult and never totally in control by being astonishingly thoughtful, and kind, and, well, seductive. She was a seductive personality; hard not to love even as she could be hard to be close to.When I started working at GEN this fall and living in New York full time, I reached out to her. “I’m in remission!” she’d said brightly when we first reconnected, three years after last seeing each other and nearly five years after she first learned she had the BRCA gene and breast cancer. We drank red wine on her balcony overlooking a giant earthen pit in the ground: The future NY offices of Netflix. We went to dinner at Il Buco on Bond Street (her suggestion); I could feel she was lonely. She and her husband Jim Freed had separated and were in the process of divorcing, a not so happy ending to the happily ever after story she had been astonished to stumble into in 2015, and something she was still figuring out how to write about. She started sending me things she had written as we talked about her writing a piece about Gen X politics and the 2020 race.“I am intimate with the dirt,” she wrote of the Netflix pit. “It has infiltrated everything. It is all over me and under me.

The cancer was back. There were so many tests and scans to undergo. I told her not to worry about writing it and was surprised when she filed. She said it was a good distraction from having cancer. She badly wanted to interview Beto O’Rourke, but by the time he arrived in New York City where they might have had a face-to-face — the Gen X skate-punk candidate and the Gen X icon — he was already getting ready to drop out of the race.She sent me a long piece about her past year, about her impending divorce and her marriage and her mother and Donald Trump. It was from something longer she was working on, she said.We talked about her writing an additional passage when she recovered from brain surgery and running the piece on Medium. “I suppose I have to add something about this, since so much of the piece is about cancer,” she texted. “You know, of all my failures of imagination, I never wondered what a brain tumor is like. So I could not have guessed it was this atrocious, the dizziness and the pain.”Her recoveries from the relentless march of the disease during her final, dreadful month would prove to be brief.After her first brain surgery — she had two to cope with her metastatic breast cancer and subsequent complications — which she described as a “brain resection,” she was astonishingly herself. She was funny and poetic and articulate and in good spirits. Still dizzy and unstable — the tumor had impacted her balance center and left her clutching the furniture as she walked during her last night in her own home — but also still herself. She laughed with her mother, who took video and pictures of her in the hospital and helped coordinate, along with Jim and some of her oldest friends from college, a parade of sun-up to way past winter sundown visitors so that she would never feel alone.And the night before the surgery, Jim was the one she stayed with. He was the one who took care of Alistair, her dog, and her black cat, Arabella. When I saw him in the hospital, he was entirely attuned to her and what she might need so that she could recover and have, in the unspoken best-case scenario, another year.“I can’t get over how great my husband has been with this. He has made it possible for me to get better and not worry about anything,” she wrote in mid-December, after the surgery. “He loves you so much it’s clear,” I texted back, thinking of how attentive he had been, how he was arranging visits with so many people, that look on his face that you cannot fake. “I think so,” she texted back. “It’s good you see. I love him so much.”But the past year had been a hard one. This is what she had written about it. She had shown it to Jim too, and he agreed, as did a number of her oldest friends, that she’d want it published. She loved to be published.By Elizabeth WurtzelGreetings from the chaotic land of marriage come undone.The caravansary is dismantling, toothpicks flying everywhere, the bubblegum that held it together is unstuck.Everything is falling.My husband moved out at the end of December [2018], as the calendar flipped from last year to this [2019], while I was in Miami Beach, strolling the walkways in the shocking morning sun and under the nighttime Van Gogh sky, away from it all.I knew he was moving out, but still: I was surprised.I did not see that the game was over. I did not know the clock was running. I never lose, but I do run out of time. It turns out this was basketball and not baseball.While I looked away, my marriage fell apart.I fell off my keel. I lost my kilter. I was a kite without a string.Maybe it’s better.It is a peaceful purple without him here. But psychedelic with disarray.Marriage is an organizing principle. It is flow. It is coffee in the morning. It is who walks the dog. It is HBO at night.And love. Don’t forget that.Now I am an ombré mess of a person. I am missed appointments and canceled meetings. I am the thing I forgot to do. I am hanging on by a strand of Drybar dry-shampooed hair.All day long I have to ask people to forgive me, I am flailing and failing at it all. Forgive me, I beg, as I hope my untweezed eyebrows will. Maybe soon, I will even tug at a few strays.Or maybe wild is the way.🖤🖤🖤I still think of Jim as this sweet person I married. He is my trust fall. He is my emergency contact. He is my next of kin. He is my valentine. He is my birthday dinner. He is my secret sharer. He is my husband.I do not know him anymore so I do not know myself. Who are my friends? Where is my family? I have fallen into a crevasse of nobody nowhere.I am estranged and strange, strangled up in blue.I do not want to feel this way. I am going through the five stages of grief all at once, which Reddit strings have no doubt turned into 523. They are a collision course, a Robert Moses plan, a metropolitan traffic system of figuring it out.I feel bad and mad and sad.Is this a festival of insight or a clusterfuck of stupid? I change my mind all the time about this and about everything else.I got married because I was done with crazy. But here it is, back again, the revenant I cannot shake. I feel like it’s 1993, when my heart had a black eye all the time.26 is a boxing match of the soul.I did not expect bruises at 52.🖤🖤🖤I have blamed myself. I have blamed my husband. I have blamed cancer. I have blamed marijuana. I have blamed sexism. I have blamed Charlottesville. I have blamed my in-laws. I have blamed several men named David. I have blamed my mother who lied to me my whole life about who my father is.Who would I be if I did not blame Donald Trump?I am angry all the time since the election of 2016, like it happened to me, like I was gang-raped by Michigan. I don’t want to be angry, but so there, I am.Who don’t I hate?Who won’t I blame?If you are standing there, I blame you.It is not conservative against liberal.It is everybody against everyone. Here we are, in it together, alone.The problem is not arguments I have with people who voted for Trump, who I don’t know anyway. The trouble is the way all of us who agree about everything are bickering. Oh, the narcissism of small differences.I remember not that long ago when the world was not political. I was part of landmark litigation that was all about a team of Republicans and Democrats working together. I loved everybody. We were all on the same side.What Alamo did I not forgive? What Masada did I not get over?Now there is no microaggression too small for me to scream about so the next four neighborhoods can hear.My husband does something and I am affronted like it matters.I am sure he does not know how I feel.And maybe he doesn’t.But what does any of this have to do with why we got married? We got married to be in it together. Polarization has even invaded love.I have anger fatigue. I am sick of sick. Like everyone.The emotional toll of the world we live in is going to do all of us in.But politics is not about conflict.Politics is about making the world a better place.🖤🖤🖤How could my mother keep a secret for 50 years? What makes someone do that?She buried herself in it. She grew a wild Victorian garden with thorny bushes of rose and purple larkspur and red snapdragon. There was a lush meadow of lavender that gave a whiff of Aix-en-Provence en été. The dandelions ran rampant and the daffodils glowed yellow like Big Bird.But underneath it all, beneath the lilies of the valley and the rows of geranium, there is dirt.There is a secret.I am a bastard. I am her bastard daughter.There are things that come along that are a shock.I believed something for nearly half a century. It was a lie.I was conned.I was wrong about myself.I did not know who I am.My mother told no one.It was a lie she told for so long it became true and the secret faded to no-memory. She misremembered who my father was. She did not think it mattered.When it all came out in 2016, not long after I got married, just after my real father died, my mother could not see what my hysteria was about. She did not understand why I was stunned.All the while I was trying not to feel the worst way ever, trying not to be overwhelmed by the explosion, my mother could not figure out what was bothering me.After all, she is the nuclear physicist.My mother is like everyone else. She thinks she is normal. She is sure her behavior makes sense. She believes she does the right thing. Since she cannot imagine that this is not the case, she is surprised to find out that, yes, she makes bombs.I scream at my mother, “What’s wrong with you?!”I do that and she does not know what I mean.She says, “Oh get over it.”Her eyes widen until they look like goggles on an herbivore. She is put upon. She cannot believe we have to discuss this yet again.“Omigod yet again!”When will I quit badgering her?I say, “You lied to me.”She says, “It wasn’t a lie.”“Then what?”“It was a decision!”Any relationship founded on a lie is doomed. Or not a lie, according to her, which is another lie, a lie about a lie.That is how it is between us. We are living in the doom.And yet, we are still at it. My mother and I refuse to give up. She is my only parent. She is all I have.She made sure of that.This is the most painful thing ever.She has made so many inexplicable decisions over the years that I know about, and now I see the ones I did not know.And yet I love her more than anyone else in the world.She is it for me. She is in the way of everything. I should be interested in my husband, but how can he compete with how much I want to figure out the Once that started all that is upon a time?🖤🖤🖤I was a welter of emotions.I was so emotional.When I found out that my father is not my father, that my mother lied to me my whole life, that there was so much I did not know, a bomb dropped in my life. Bombs, really, aerial bombardment. It was the Battle of Manila: bazookas, flamethrowers, grenades, tanks, cannons, howitzers, banzai charges, kamikaze tactics, I was shocked and stunned with feeling.I did not know what to do.I became a raging lunatic.I was a mettle of rage.My rage is my retinue. My rage is a filthy velveteen train I drag around with me, carelessly. It is my ruby tiara. It is my rainbow and my pot of gold.My rage is cream. It makes Chock Full O’ Nuts coffee that my grandmother brewed in a percolator on the breakfront in the dining room taste not half bad.It is the coloratura harmony to my singsong days.My rage is my conscience. I insist on my right to feel.But I got caught in a Möbius strip of emotion. I was gone round the bend of scream.It was stuplimity.🖤🖤🖤My marriage is crushed beneath the weight of so much. It is delicate, like all relationships. It is not one of those fine elms that blows with the gusts and does not snap.We are a scattering of branches on the lawn. We are deadwood.Oh, there is a lot that holds us together, the love and the hours. We got married during chemotherapy. We are bound.But my husband is not who he was.Yes, I know: It is always like that. The sorrow of unraveling is the stranger you are facing. What happened? I want to scream. Where did you go?My husband had a softness. I will not compare it to the feel of cotton balls or the touch of silk charmeuse, because it is better. He was new to love. I could tell. I could see. He was surprised. He did not see me coming. He did not know I was interested. He was alone in a room. His life was small. He had the same six friends he always had. He was shy. He was not brave. He had no expectations.He was lovely.The beginning is always like honey, liquid and sweet.But he was open.He was not wounded by a million heartaches.He had not been through it all.He did not have a wretched past.He was 34, which is not young. Younger than I was, but a lot could have happened by then.It had not.He was fresh.There was nothing I would not do for him.There was nothing I did not want for him.We met in October and got engaged in May.We knew.And now he knows he has had enough.It has been too much.🖤🖤🖤Most of all, it is not easy to be married to someone with cancer.I feel for my husband.Cancer is so big. Everyone is prostrate before its deadly enormity. It is the answer to every question. It is the reason why. Is it an excuse or is it real? Who is anyone to argue? Cancer is a bully. It is an elephantine disease of body, mind, soul. My husband moved a half a mile away from it. I would love to do the same.I am stuck until the end.I do not know what he expected when he married me when I was ill. I am sorry that it has not been what he wanted. I am sorry that I hurt him.After I got cancer, I was not the same.I wanted to be.I wanted my life to go back to what it was.I was so lively. I was so lovely.I was so busy. I was so social.But I could not do it.No surprise, I changed.I was withdrawn during chemotherapy and my world became small. It contracted like starvation. It is hard to get back what is lost. It is more difficult still to begin anew.I tried. So hard. I called. I emailed. I texted. I showed up.But there was a diminishment.Cancer is an ecosystem. It is a crime spree.Things broke. My radius. My fibula. My tibia. My spirit.My cancer came back a year after it went away.You think people are nice about it? No.Cancer is misunderstood.Everyone says the wrong thing. Which is what they do so much anyway.Then I say the wrong thing back.There we are, bumper cars of mismatched words.I can’t believe the stupid things people tell me in an effort to be kind, about something hard they had to deal with that is not the same as having cancer.The worst thing anyone can do is tell me they are sorry about my cancer.I don’t want anyone feeling sorry for me. About anything. Don’t apologize unless you have done something wrong. It is nasty to feel sorry for anyone for any reason because it pushes her away.Mostly sorry is just a thing to say. Anything else would be better, including I don’t know what to say.It is always people who are the problem. What else? Our suffering is small compared to our misunderstandings with others, how they fail to give us a break, know what it’s like, judge us fairly, see the world the way we do. It is not even cancer or especially cancer. It is especially this and even that. If you are looking for absolution, you are going to have to forgive yourself.I have chainmail from years of frustrating conversations, of people who think something bad has happened to me.I don’t see it that way.You could tell me everything that’s bad about cancer, like that it’s cancer, but you could not convince me that cancer has been bad for me.Cancer has made me optimistic.These are the days of miracles and wonders, of biopharma fireworks, of immunotherapy wow.I have been saved.I am miraculous me.I will skate figure eights into infinity.I am all claws I am all fangs.I am not afraid of cancer. I think cancer should be afraid of me.This past October [2018], I had a tumor in my shoulder bone that was 5 inches: big! It was threatening to break it.And worse.My cancer antigens were at 205, when 25 is as high as the level can go.I had meetings in the World Trade Center while all this was going on. I hate it down there. Skyscrapers as grave markers. It is an ominous place.When I went for help in Philadelphia at the Basser Center for BRCA at the University of Pennsylvania, only Alistair, my service dog, was with me.My husband said he had to work.My marriage had already come undone.I had stereotactic radiation at Memorial Sloan Kettering. It took only three sessions to zap the tumor away. The treatment saved me, but I have a five-inch hole in my bone that looks like a cave in the Thai jungle.When my husband moved out, I was still healing. I have a rotator cuff tear and pain from the long way home.🖤🖤🖤This is a love story.Every marriage is a love story.People who run off to Vegas after knowing each other for 10 days and find a drunk outside the Sands casino to be their witness — they really mean it. Marriage is a big gesture. There is no reason to do it except: love.It is effusive.I am sorry I failed.I am sorry for this confederacy of catastrophe.I am sorry for it all.I think that my husband can’t believe I hurt. I know what I’m like: I have a powerful personality, it’s true. But he got me.He made a vow to love me in sickness and in health.There was great love between us.And love is hard to stop.We made a commitment for when we could not remember why we did.He decided enough.I am a monotheist. I am in it for life. I am in everything for life. If you don’t stop me, I will not stop myself. I have the kind of faith that you can only have if you have talked your way out of trouble all along.I feel so much and too much. Deep in my radiated bones.I cannot believe it is like this with my husband and not like it was that long ago on Halloween, our first date, which he did not know was a date, maybe it was maybe it wasn’t, he showed up at my door not knowing anything at all.We were resting on our future arms, we were like people who have never read The Unbearable Lightness of Being, have never seen City of God, have never heard Exile In Guyville, oh what lay ahead.I remember my husband in the beginning, I know the man I married, I insist he is still there somewhere.I keep peeling for the pentimento.Or has this all been a fraud?Love gone wrong feels like a confidence crime.That is the worst of it.Do I have an electron microscope or am I blinded? Do I see more clearly now or is this a distortion? I could ask that about the whole wide world.Sex and race look different since Trump was elected. We know all the things that we never knew. We were living in a world of trust, we believed we were on a righteous path, that things were incrementally improving, so we did not look so hard into sunlight.All anything ever is is another way of seeing.I thought my husband was on my side.I thought I knew him.I did.I don’t.He changed.I do not know how to help him.I do not know how to reach him.Anything is possible.I believe in so much.I am just that way.I believe in love.What matters more in this crazy world?Shame on Casablanca’s ending! I will take the hill of beans.(This is Garance again.)Love. Sometimes in our lives when we feel most bereft it turns out that we are not alone at all. It is the kind of cloying Disney sentiment Lizzie might have scoffed at, but it was also the truth with her. She affected a toughness that was both real and a coping mechanism, but which also led her to downplay how sick she was. Even as she was telling me she was in remission in September, spots of cancer had already returned, I have since learned.“The people who know us when we are not our best selves — what would we do without them? I am so grateful right now for even my mother coming through for me,” she wrote after her first surgery in December. Her mother Lynne Winters and she had a famously complicated relationship, but it was Lynne who took her home to recover both times she was released from the hospital, and who had the difficult burden of having to bring her back, and who sobbed in the sparkling clean MSKCC neuro ward hallway where other parents of too-young-to-die adult children paced forlornly.“Jim has been the best,” Lizzie texted after the surgery. “I wish you a great first husband. That might be all you need.”They had, in fact, not divorced. The papers were signed, but not filed. He was her husband until the end, during the final days after it was clear no further interventions would work, when she lay still in bed in what was by then her at least fifth different hospital room, for all the world the image of a big-eyed Renaissance pieta looking heavenward.“Neurology takes a positive view toward god and prayer,” she had texted after the first surgery. “And relinquishing, which is what god and prayer is about. It is always turning your will over to a higher power and letting the will of the world and not your extraordinary manipulations lead you to your desired result. I always say that, it is my constant prayer: god, if you are out there, watch over me and your will, not mine, be done. That is what will happen anyway, but I pray for release from the dreadful fight.”She spent her whole life fighting — fighting her parents, society, the patriarchy, social conventions, addiction, depression. But man, did she live big. She had a gift for building love into her life and at the end, her friends built a cocoon of love around her.And on the morning of January 7, 2020, she was, as she had prayed, released.Written by"
50,"It’s Dry January, and Why Are We Doing This Again?","For more information on the novel coronavirus and Covid-19, visit cdc.gov.Heineken’s January Dry Pack looks like an advent calendar but for nonalcoholic drinks. The pack contains 31 cans of 0.0% alcohol by volume beer — one for each day of January — hidden behind tear-off cutouts. Every day of the month, abstainers can enjoy the taste of a cold beer without cheating on their resolution to give up alcohol.“Dry January” is both a badge of honor and a kick-in-the-pants response to the guilt that can come with excess. You got a little too sloppy over the holidays; why not repent for your “Wet December” with a “Dry January”?While the concept of a month without drinking isn’t novel (“detox” diets like Whole30 ask people to give up alcohol for 30 days), the New Year’s timing adds an extra element of “renewal.” Since people tend to drink more in November and December, a January free of alcohol can feel like an opportunity to reset and reconsider drinking habits.Dry January unofficially started in 2011 when Emily Robinson, then the deputy CEO for a U.K. charity called Alcohol Concern, gave up drinking in January while training for a half marathon. Robinson was thrilled with the results: Not only did she lose weight, sleep better, and have more energy for the race, it seemed everyone wanted to talk to her about what it was like to stop drinking for a month. She decided to take her experiment to her job, where she could help more people experience the same benefits of a monthlong alcohol fast.Alcohol Concern merged with Alcohol Research U.K. in 2012 to form Alcohol Change, a nonprofit focused on improving public health in the U.K. by reducing alcohol-related harm. Inspired by Robinson, Alcohol Change launched the first official Dry January initiative in 2013. Around 4,000 people took part that year according to a survey by market research firm YouGov. The Dry January movement has grown steadily since: Between 2017 and 2019, YouGov surveys show more than four million people in the U.K. have participated each year.“Dry January is a time when each of us can take a look at our drinking habits and decide whether we’re happy with them, setting us up for the year ahead,” says Julie Symes, a senior communication manager at Alcohol Change. “Drinking alcohol can be fun, but it also has drawbacks and risks, so it’s vital that we all talk and think about our drinking, so we can make decisions rather than falling into habits that might not be healthy.”​There’s evidence to suggest that a month of abstinence from booze can do the body some good, especially if you’re someone who consumes alcohol regularly. Research published in the U.K. in 2018 found that quitting drinking for 30 days had a notable effect on health.The study followed 141 moderate-to-heavy drinkers who consumed an average of 30 drinks a week (more than double the U.K.-recommended limit of 14 drinks a week for both men and women). Of these people, 94 gave up drinking completely for a month while the remainder continued drinking as normal. Blood samples drawn at the end of the month showed no significant changes among the people who drank while the nondrinkers saw benefits in the reduction of blood cancer proteins along with other health benefits, like lower blood pressure, lower cholesterol, and a reduced risk of diabetes.The Dry January alcohol fast can also have a longer-term effect on drinking habits for some people. A different 2018 U.K. study of more than 800 Dry January devotees found that 70% of people who abstained were still drinking less seven months later. Among the people in the study, the average number of drinking days per week dropped from 4.3 to 3.3 from January to August, and the average number of times a month people reported being drunk dropped from 3.4 times to 2.1.Whether people choose to abstain from alcohol because of health concerns or guilt about gluttony, Dry January makes for an appealing challenge for anyone who wants to ensure that their drinking habits are “normal” or at least within their control. This motivation can feel especially strong in American culture, where hitting the brakes on a bad habit is just as prevalent as bad habits themselves.In the United States last year, 1 in 5 people (of 1,496 participants) surveyed by YouGov said they were doing Dry January. There’s no official, government-sanctioned effort for Dry January in the States, but it’s not hard to find grassroots support for alcohol abstinence. There are Dry January programs sponsored by local health care systems, Dry January Facebook groups, and brands like Heineken peddling their own Dry January products.Longer-term abstinence, sometimes referred to as elective sobriety, has also become an American trend. As writer Virginia Sole-Smith wrote in Elemental in April, it’s not surprising that people in the U.S. are questioning their relationship with alcohol given how great an influence drinking has on American socializing. “I thought often of all the times I’ve ordered a drink I didn’t particularly want to avoid the social awkwardness of not holding one; of how many friends’ pregnancies I’ve sussed out because it’s so noteworthy when they suddenly switch to seltzer,” Sole-Smith writes. “We’ve made alcohol a de facto part of ending the workday, eating brunch, celebrating birthdays, and so many other mundane moments of daily life; it is embedded in what it means to be a sophisticated adult, eating amazing food, wearing great clothes, and generally living the good life.”When people swing between excess and deprivation, it’s usually due to what he calls an “evolutionary mismatch” between the brain and its surroundings.As much as it’s a chance for better health and personal growth, Dry January is also reflective of the excess and deprivation cycle that’s become rampant in American culture. Giving up alcohol might seem like a natural, necessary consequence after a period of heavier drinking or even a method for setting better future habits in motion. But experts say a monthlong fast isn’t the best way to promote healthy, long-term habits even if there are short-term health benefits.“I do think that there is a mentality in the U.S. especially that people will drink to excess in parties and other social situations, and the counterweight to that is ‘let me just do something like Dry January and cut it off.’ It’s a boom or bust kind of cycle,” says Art Markman, a psychologist at the University of Texas, Austin, who studies consumer behavior and decision-making. “But the strategy of a one-month trial period doesn’t create a process for living your life with moderation.”Moderation isn’t exactly a hallmark of American consumption, partly because people are hardwired to want more when more is available. Glenn Geher, an evolutionary psychology professor at SUNY New Paltz, says when people swing between excess and deprivation, it’s usually due to what he calls an “evolutionary mismatch” between the brain and its surroundings. Basically, the brain hasn’t evolved to deal with having an abundance of resources available. Geher says evolutionary mismatches can occur in virtually any context, from technology and pornography to substances like alcohol and tobacco.Thousands of years ago, because food was scarce (and needed to be hunted and gathered), human ancestors wouldn’t have taken a “break” from food or other substances. Today humanity has an abundance of resources, including easy access to a cheap bottle of chardonnay, but people are still wired with the same scarcity mindset — which can lead to an unhealthy excess.“We, like any organism, evolved to hoard resources because once, resources were scarce,” Geher says. “We now live in a world where you can get as much high-calorie cheap food and alcohol as you want, and that’s why we go on diets and need to moderate. We have environmental conditions we didn’t evolve to anticipate.”Unhealthy consumption patterns are also associated with how accessible everything is for most Americans, Geher says. “Most middle-class people can afford to drink every night if they want. We live in an existence where the resources we evolved to crave because they were rare are now plentiful,” he says. That means it’s easier to overdo it, and not just with food.Geher recognizes how hard it is to maintain a healthy balance when surrounded by things the brain is wired to desire. But he doesn’t see total deprivation as the solution. “Cultivating moderation, especially with alcohol, is famously difficult,” he says. “All of these unnatural things co-opt our brains and give us more than we ever would have had under ancestral conditions, but I think the all-or-nothing, on-the-wagon, off-the-wagon thing can be dangerous.”“You truly have a lot more agency when everything is on the table and nothing is ‘good’ or ‘bad.’”Christy Harrison, a dietitian and author of Anti-Diet, believes a more moderate approach to cutting back could yield more health benefits than cycles of abundance and periods of deprivation because most black-and-white approaches are inherently self-perpetuating. “When people are pulled over to the side of restriction, there’s this inevitable pendulum swing into feeling out of control. That’s a natural response to restriction,” she says.It’s also due to an American tendency to label things — especially food and even alcohol — as “good” and “bad.”“If you feel out of control in an area of your life, the solution isn’t to exert even more control and forbid something but to try to make peace with that thing, to find a middle ground,” she says. “You can choose what feels good, satisfying, and pleasurable. You truly have a lot more agency when everything is on the table and nothing is ‘good’ or ‘bad.’”If people drink because they’re wired for excess and then deprive themselves to make up for it and neither is an effective long-term strategy, how can they achieve moderation? Markman says as much as deprivation fuels excessive behavior, adopting moderation can breed motivation. It’s often easier to stick to goals when you allow yourself a bit of a gray area. That’s thanks to a real psychological phenomenon called the ‘‘what the hell effect.” Essentially, when you draw a bright line between right and wrong, on the day you happen to step over the line, you’re much more likely to say “screw it.”“You think, ‘As long as I’m already across the line, I may as well do whatever. If I’m doing Dry January and have a drink, I may as well have six drinks,’” Markman says. On the other hand, if you adopt a more realistic, moderate goal to have four drinks a week and you accidentally have five, you’ll be more likely to stay the course for the long haul. “Five is still close to four, so you’ll have more motivation to stick with what you’re doing,” Markman says.In addition to promoting deprivation and binge cycles, there’s another reason Dry January — and really any fast — may not work long-term: It doesn’t give you any opportunity to rehearse moderation. “You’re not practicing going out in a social situation and having two drinks. It is that practice that turns out to be important because you have to confront a temptation to have more and develop strategies to avoid that,” Markman says. “If you don’t figure that out in advance, you’re putting yourself in the face of temptation, and the most natural thing to do is to give in to it.”For a better shot at long-term sustainability, Markman says it’s probably best not to treat it as a crash diet. “Even if you nail Dry January, you haven’t learned anything that would lead you to be able to change your life,” he says. If you do opt to participate in Dry January, the key to a better long-term relationship with alcohol is thinking through how you plan to handle drinking when February 1 rolls around. Because in the absence of any additional planning, February 1 is really no different than December 31.Written by"
51,Your Only New Year’s Resolution Should Be to Hibernate,"For more information on the novel coronavirus and Covid-19, visit cdc.gov.It’s nearly January 1. Instead of popping a painkiller and heading full throttle into 360-degree total life reform, here’s a novel thought: What if you chose to stay cozy under the blanket just a little longer, using that time for extra sleep, meditation, or quiet reflection? And what if taking it easy was actually the healthier choice — truly the best way to start the upcoming year off right?Despite the New Year’s Day trope of repenting, reinventing, and heading to the gym immediately, many of the world’s most ancient and trusted healing philosophies advocate an opposite approach to this midwinter period. Hibernate, they say.Practices from Ayurveda to traditional Chinese medicine (or TCM) espouse common principles like “grounding,” which refers to the concept of finding balance and connection in one’s life by acting in accordance with our natural internal instincts and the Earth’s seasonal cycles. “Winter offers us an opportunity to connect deeply with ourselves — physically and mentally preparing for new growth ahead,” explains Dr. Pratima Raichur, a chemist, botanist, Ayurvedic physician, and author. “In Ayurveda, we use nature as our teacher. The shorter, dark days — full of water, ice, and snow — are a time of cleansing, gestating, and preparing for the new beginnings of spring.”Ayurveda is a more than 3,000-year-old system of medicine that aims to treat individuals by creating balance in the body based on three elemental categories called “doshas,” representing elements like earth, fire, water, air, and ether. According to that philosophy, and many other healing traditions, when it’s cold outside and the days are shorter, the best way to care for our minds and bodies is to slow down, store up energy, nourish ourselves, and make preparations for the coming year.Perhaps the most important — and logical — way to store energy for warmer days is to get ample sleep. According to Rachel Abrams, MD, integrative and family medicine doctor and author of Body Wise: Discovering Your Body’s Intelligence for Lifelong Health and Healing, Americans currently get an average of six-and-a-half hours of sleep per night. At the turn of the 20th century, the average was nine to 10 hours. That reduction is, in part, due to the proliferation of electricity. Back in the day, when it got dark, people sat by fire or candlelight or went to bed. “Winter is the natural time to sleep more, and Mother Nature is helping us out by creating more darkness,” says Dr. Abrams (known as “Doctor Rachel” by her patients), whose approach involves looking at root causes of disease and at the entire life of each patient. “We’re such a sleep-deprived culture, which negatively impacts mood, creativity, concentration, and patience with children and colleagues. So, we should really be stopping work and going to bed earlier.”The biggest modern-day deterrent to getting more sleep is screen time. According to Dr. Abrams, not only do our devices distract us, they also send the wrong physiological signals to our bodies. Full-spectrum blue light wakes us up and suppresses the body’s melatonin production. (According to a study in Sleep Medicine, teenagers who use devices for even an hour a day get appreciably less sleep than they did just six years ago.)Full-spectrum lights aren’t all bad, though. Dr. Abrams recommends surrounding yourself with them during daytime hours — either by getting outside, buying full-spectrum bulbs or even buying a light box (which has the added bonus of helping with seasonal affective disorder in both serious cases and for people who just feel a bit down and crave tons of carbs). “When the light hits the back of your retina, it helps ward off depression in winter months,” she explains. Using those lights exclusively in daytime can help your body regulate melatonin levels for bedtime. Then, at night, Abrams advises a switch to dim yellow incandescent lights, which help your body prepare for sleep.In terms of setting new goals or habits, Dr. Abrams suggests integrating more restful, quiet practices in winter. “If you want to change your life, then you have to change your mind and attitude and there’s no better way to do that than with meditation,” she says. “It’s the perfect kind of resolution because, if you get your mind in the right place, everything else follows.”“Just as trees lose their leaves and animals hibernate (as we are animals too), we’re meant to stay in and do more restorative activities… Then, springtime is when you want to burst forth with the energy that’s been stored.”In traditional Chinese medicine (or TCM), winter is also seen as a time of restful contemplation. “We look to nature for cues,” says Holly Crafts Colasanti, a licensed acupuncturist and board-certified Chinese herbalist. “Just as trees lose their leaves and animals hibernate (as we are animals too), we’re meant to stay in and do more restorative activities. We’re going for a more yin space that’s about quietude and turning inward. Then, springtime is when you want to burst forth — like the blooming of the leaves and flowers — with the energy that’s been stored.”Starting the new year off with a commitment to a healthier diet is a positive impulse, but adopting an all salad or raw food diet may not actually be beneficial. In fact, it may put unnecessary strain on the body. “Chinese medicine discourages eating cold and raw foods in winter because they slow you down,” she explains. “Your body is already being asked to warm itself metabolically because of the cold temperatures; eating cooling summer foods — cucumbers or watermelon, for example — is asking your body to do extra work. That uses up a lot of energy that you’re supposed to be storing.”One clear marker of winter stress can be dehydrated or cracked skin, so that’s something to watch. Crafts Colasanti, who was inspired to pursue TCM because of her own struggles with psoriasis, often approaches this challenge by using food as medicine. To keep the body working optimally, she suggests nourishing and warming cooked dishes like baked pears, sweet potatoes, and stew. Fermented foods — from kefir to sauerkraut — are also helpful, she says, as they fan our inherent metabolic fire by supporting the diversity and healthy populations of intestinal flora and gut microbiota.Above all else, Crafts Colasanti suggests bone broth and, for vegetarians and vegans, mushroom broth (with dried and fresh mushrooms), both rich in collagen and minerals. “Bone broth is great for retaining flexibility in your skin and bones,” she explains. “And you want that secure barrier in order to withstand environmental stressors like wind and cold.”What does “grounding” look like, in practice? “The beginning of winter is dry and crisp, which is high on air energy, while the snowy, damp time of the season is a manifestation of earth and water energies. This means we should practice and enjoy activities that are warm, dry, and light,” explains Raichur.That doesn’t mean lying around and doing nothing, necessarily. It just suggests focusing more on preparation, connection, and cleansing than on intense forward motion. “There is deep work that needs to be done in winter,” Raichur asserts. “It is a ripe time to plant seeds of intention.” She suggests donating old or unused belongings, instituting self-care regimens like warm baths with uplifting aromatherapy oils, eating and drinking warm foods and teas, and spending time with friends and family. “Love each other, feed each other, be close and feel your sense of connection and vitality soar!”There’s a time and place for pushing forward, full-force, and midwinter isn’t necessarily it. But the colder season offers other compensations, including an opportunity to rest, look inward, and mindfully prepare for the coming spring.Written by"
52,Your Life Is Not a Story,"Recently I visited some old friends who moved, a few years ago, from New York City to Portland, Oregon. In New York, Brian and Lara had been the staying-at-homest people I knew, which made sense since they also had the nicest home of anyone I knew — a large apartment on the 45th floor in midtown, with a view of the Chrysler and Empire State Buildings. Our usual routine was: I’d go over to their place, we’d order takeout, have some wine, and watch something like Battlestar Galactica. But since moving to Portland, they have unexpectedly, at age 50, become rave kids. To hear them explain it, it was a natural progression: They realized they really enjoyed dancing at weddings, and it occurred to them that they didn’t need to wait for a wedding to dance, so they started checking out some local clubs, and now they go almost every weekend. But when you only see a snapshot of your friends once every few years, gradual changes look like abrupt, bizarre metamorphoses: when they first sent me photos of themselves in luminescent costumes with goggles, antennae, and diaphanous capes, I felt like a Philip K. Dick character getting a glimpse into an alternate timeline.“I have often noticed,” writes Humbert Humbert in Nabokov’s Lolita, “that we are inclined to endow our friends with the stability of type that literary characters acquire in the reader’s mind.” One of the things I liked about my old friend Skelly was that whenever I saw him he was always so exactly himself, in fact even more himself than I’d remembered; he always borrowed 20 dollars, was always the first to spill a drink, always put on Led Zeppelin before passing out. He was as consistent as a cartoon character, like Wimpy with his hamburgers-on-credit habit. He stayed the same old Skelly right up until he broke character by unexpectedly dropping dead and revealing himself to have been secretly insane, with a house full of nightmarish detritus. It’s easy to forget that we only ever see facets of other people, never the whole (not even in marriage) — and in those facets what we’re mostly seeing is some aspect of ourselves.More and more I’m simply interested in seeing how everyone else’s choices turned out, what became of us all.Years ago I wrote an essay called “The Referendum,” about how people eye each other’s differing life choices — about careers, marriage, kids, homes — with envy or disapproval, out of an underlying anxiety about having chosen the wrong life themselves. But by the time you’re past life’s midpoint, and your own life starts to look more like a fait accompli than a work-in-progress, your investment in defending or second-guessing your own decisions ebbs; more and more I’m simply interested in seeing how everyone else’s choices turned out, what became of us all — my own small sample of results in the uncontrolled experiment that is life. I like it, for purely selfish, spectatorial reasons, whenever people do the less conventional, less expected thing in life, the same way I enjoy certain friends who aren’t necessarily “nice” people, because they’re like characters in a book who reliably make any scene they’re in more interesting. My friend Kevin, surely in the running for my most irresponsible friend, a crowded and competitive field — this is a man who gave himself gout with his excess — has fathered a child, and is now, to all appearances, a happy small-town dad. Another friend, Harold, has meanwhile announced his retirement “from public life,” and now dedicates himself to “The Great Work”: reading rare and obscure works of supernatural literature. My friend Diana realized, a few years ago, that she identified as queer: The catalyst for this epiphany was falling in love with a trans partner, which allowed her to embrace aspects of herself she’d always resisted and flout conventions she’d too long felt bound by. When I first met her, she dressed like Nancy Drew — not unfeminine, but more girl-detective than girly-girl. She’s since declared she’s never wearing a goddamn dress again; she wore a dapper pinstriped vest and pants at her wedding. (It’s one of the sillier items in the PRO column in my deciding whether to have children at 50: No one will have seen that coming.) It’s exhilarating to thwart the predictable script, break free of determinism now and then and flex what little free will we have. These twists and reversals remind me that I don’t know people as well as I think I do, and reassure me that we’re all still capable, even in midlife, of surprise.Surveying this local panorama of human destinies, it’s hard to know what general conclusion they might entail other than: Life is certainly funny.Not that we’re obliged to make our lives interesting for the amusement of some imaginary reader-God. There’s a difference between what we want to want, or think we ought to want, and what we actually want, and the sooner we recognize which is which, the happier we’ll be. A former student of mine confessed that she felt as though she’d given up, been defeated, when she left New York (a city that makes you look cool but feel miserable), but once she accepted her exile in the Bay Area, she couldn’t believe she was allowed to live a life she enjoyed so much. Brian and Lara’s life in Portland isn’t one I would’ve chosen for myself, but they seem far happier than they were in Manhattan, vegging out on the couch. Harold has renounced the company of womankind, and is drifting contentedly out of touch with humanity in his recliner, reading titles like The Flying Beast, but he is inarguably a happier man than I am; he knows exactly what he wants to do with his remaining time on Earth, and he’s doing it. Surveying this local panorama of human destinies, it’s hard to know what general conclusion they might entail other than: Life is certainly funny.I write nonfiction because I don’t understand life well enough to make things up. Back when I studied writing in college, even today’s tiny, fragile publishing niche for essay and memoir didn’t exist, so we were taught to write short stories. I had no aptitude for fiction: I could never figure out how to reconcile the demands of Aristotelian dramaturgy with verisimilitude, to construct a satisfying story that resembled anything like real life. The narrative form real life most closely resembles is the soap opera — a long, meandering, pointless story without resolution, in which nothing much happens for long stretches, punctuated by the occasional incredible coincidence or improbable tragedy. It’s what Homer Simpson called “just a bunch of stuff that happened.” Inventing things that might plausibly happen would require a better grasp of life’s basic operating principles than I can pretend to; all I can do is write down what actually happened, and maybe venture some guesses as to why. The best fiction acknowledges that character is too complex to define, destiny unguessable: only bad stock characters are consistent and predictable; great literary characters, like people in real life, remain a little elusive, their motives opaque even to themselves. The novels I reread most often are ones whose characters are credible, familiar, but hover just the other side of comprehensibility; every time I open the book I hope that if only they’d make different decisions at crucial moments, it might all turn out differently.It’s a mistake to try to force your life to conform to a script. I still have the timeline of my future life that I wrote up in pencil on a piece of college-ruled notebook paper when I was 12. Let’s see: By my present age I was supposed to have already published several science fiction novels and run for President. (You know how it goes; it’s hard to get around to everything. I did write some books, at least.) This is why I have so little helpful advice to give younger colleagues: Unless your life has gone boringly according to plan, it probably isn’t a replicable sequence of intentional steps. It’s less like a pathway — deliberately cut, following the most efficient route — than stepping-stones: a random scattering of happenstance that led you where you are now. It’s also a fallacy, if an irresistible one, to try to interpret life like a text (this is at least one purpose of therapy: to render your life as an intelligible narrative). Beyond a few broad Aesop’s morals — e.g., drugs appear to be bad for you, children seem to make people feel fulfilled, once you have enough money to live on, making more doesn’t make you any happier — we’re all just groping our way through the days, lucky if we get a moment to wonder what life is for. We barely have enough time to collect enough data to draw any conclusions before it’s all over. A recurring religious metaphor is that if we could only step back far enough to view the mosaic whole, it would form a coherent picture — God’s master plan, the grand design — and at last we would understand. For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face.I recently saw 63 Up, the latest, and possibly last, installment in director Michael Apted’s Up series of documentaries, a longitudinal study chronicling the lives of a group of English men and women from the ages of seven through 63, checking in once every seven years. Apted began these films with an agenda about the determinism of class, which the films don’t invalidate, but also obviate as less relevant or interesting than the bigger mysteries of personality, life, and time. The Up series is one of the great projects in the history of cinema, an attempt to apprehend a glimpse of life whole. Its cumulative effect is a feeling beyond any emotion we have a word for, a resolution beyond sad or happy endings: It’s a fleeting God’s-eye view of life’s length and brevity, the eerie poignancy of time’s passage. It’s a perspective afforded by very few other works of art I can think of: Eliot’s Middlemarch, John Williams’s Stoner, Ozu’s Tokyo Story, Kubrick’s Barry Lyndon. For an instant we can almost make out the pattern, and in it is not meaning but beauty.I made the mistake of extrapolating in a straight-line trajectory from the present, failing to account for fortune’s corkscrew tangents.Once in a while, at weddings, reunions, or funerals, sometimes just at ordinary moments, looking around at the strange and varied fates that have been waiting for us all this time, I get a twinge of this same sensation. I feel as if I’ve traveled into the future. When I was in high school, I once made a minor time-wasting project of drawing a scrapbook from the future, illustrating all my friends’ adult lives. I wasn’t far off in some cases — although, like most people, I made the mistake of extrapolating in a straight-line trajectory from the present, failing to account for fortune’s corkscrew tangents. I imagine traveling back in time now, a visitant from the distant Blade Runner year of 2019, to the eve of high school graduation 1985, to tell my old gang their fortunes: You become an MD/PhD at the National Institute of Health (no surprise there; that’s one life that went according to plan). You’re an architect and a scout leader, with two sons. You’re disabled by depression, but have a loving and supportive wife and you’re a good husband and father. You drift from one job and state to another and die in your forties, an addict. You’ve become a broker and drive a Porsche; little trace remains of the mysterious hero once known as Beetleman. No come to think of it that’s a terrible idea. It’s probably a mercy that our future selves are quarantined off from us, that time’s firewall protects us from spoilers.One night during that trip to Portland, I got to experience a slice of Brian and Lara’s lives: All their assembled guests dressed up, took molly, and went to a rave. It happened to be Halloween weekend, and Portland enjoys a reputation, among itself, as “weird” — though it’s weird in a very white, distinctively dweeby way — which meant that there were a lot of creative, well-executed costumes on display. I saw a Spandexed fairy and a sexy Loki, a fishbowl-helmeted astronaut and Spider-Man unmasked, a tall, slender girl in a giraffe-patterned onesie and a man who’d encased his whole head in the solemn black rectangle and electronic eye of H.A.L. 9000. I saw couples entwined and undulate on the dance floor, heaps of depleted revelers flopped atop one another on cushioned daises like litters of kittens. One side effect of molly is to make people helplessly grind their teeth, which lent everyone an unfestively grotesque, feral aspect. The drug seemed to have a paradoxical effect on me, whereby rather than making me promiscuously tactile or emotionally incontinent, I became withdrawn and interior: Instead of dancing or drinking or flirting with any of the hundreds of friendly disinhibited enticingly costumed girls there, I wanted only to stand unobtrusively against a wall, observing from behind my kabuki demon mask and letting my thoughts drift around inside my head like a screensaver. I saw a woman whose face was encrusted in a mosaic of tiny mirrored tiles that shifted and flexed with her expressions (I learned it had taken her three hours to apply), each facet reflecting a fragment of the viewer. I watched several people mistake a mirror for a doorway and bonk ignominiously into their own reflections, not realizing the approaching stranger was themselves. For now we bonk into a glass, darkly. I stood there for hours, watching that chimerical crowd endlessly circulating, making grand entries and furtive exits, getting separated and regrouping, pairing up and parting again, the whole motley carnival, all those lovingly cultivated disguises, their true faces hidden, identities unknown.Written by"
53,Your Inability to Do Pullups Is All in Your Head,"Test Gym is a new Elemental column about the science of exercise.I’ve always loved pullups. They require nothing more than an overhead bar and some dig-deep grit. They’re a primal yet elegant way to test your might and strength-to-weight ratio while building core and upper-body strength.Pullups are also a show of power. Mark Wahlberg did 22 pullups in 30 seconds as a charity fundraiser on the Ellen DeGeneres Show. Former FBI boss James Comey told the New York Times he was spending the “unemployed celebrity” chapter of his life working toward a goal of doing 10 consecutive pullups.There’s a popular notion that certain bodies just aren’t capable of executing a proper pullup —the New York Times once tried to explain why women can’t do them — but there’s ample evidence to the contrary. Megan Rapinoe does pullups, because of course she does. And Eva Clarke, an Australian mother of three, set a world record in 2016 by pumping out 725 in one hour.Still, it’s true that pullups are naturally easier for some people than others. Pullups use your core, forearms, biceps, upper back, deltoids, and lats, so strength in those muscles is important, according to Stew Smith, a certified strength coach and former Navy SEAL. And it helps to be light — every extra pound is just extra weight you have to lift.The pullup is an attainable feat even if you aren’t one of those muscle heads shaped like a slice of pizza.Athletes who have strong upper bodies but are generally lean (think Nordic skiers and gymnasts) will usually have an easier time with pullups than cyclists or speedskaters, who carry their weight in their legs. Ideally, you want your weight concentrated in the body parts that are contributing to the work of a pullup, not the ones that are dead weight while you’re hoisting yourself up to the bar.But the pullup is an attainable feat even if you aren’t one of those muscle heads shaped like a slice of pizza. Marine Lt. Col. Misty Posey is living proof. Posey, who had never done sports, learned to do her first pullup out of necessity. The U.S. Marine Corps did not include pullups in the physical fitness test for women until 2017, but the officer boot camp Posey had to pass when she was becoming a Marine in the 1990s required her to get over obstacles that, at just 4 feet 10 inches tall, she was too short to jump over. Her only option was to pull herself up and over them.Posey spent almost a year trying to go from zero to one pullup using a pullup-assist machine at the base’s gym. Despite working her way up to doing 90% of her body weight for 10 pullups with the machine, she still couldn’t do a single unaided pullup. A gunnery sergeant at the gym saw Posey’s futile efforts and told her to give up the machine — it was a crutch. “Get out of the gym, and go work on the pullup bar,” he told her, instructing Posey to do a series of pullup variations like jumping pullups and half pullups.The advice was so simple that she almost dismissed it, but it worked. Three days later, Posey did her first pullup. And then she kept going.On a bet from a fellow Marine—a man who seemed surprised she could do any pullups at all—Posey worked her way up to 23 consecutive pullups in less than eight weeks to win the bet and kick her doubter’s ass. Accomplishing a pullup can be a symbol of female empowerment. When you do a pullup, Posey says, “You become the master of your own body. It’s a way to get respect.”Simply believing that you can do a pullup isn’t enough to get you there. But the notion that you can’t may be part of what’s stopping you.In the years since her first pullup, Posey has become a pullup evangelist. She has helped countless women and men of every body type learn to do the iconic exercise. “I’ve had mothers and grandmothers, and I’ve had women with up to 29% body fat get their first pullup,” she says.In hindsight, Posey says that the biggest thing stopping her from that first pullup was her own erroneous belief that she couldn’t.Of course, simply believing that you can do a pullup isn’t enough to get you there. But the notion that you can’t may be part of what’s stopping you. There’s a psychology at play in situations like these, says Sandra Hunter, an exercise scientist at Marquette University. She recalls a male colleague who decided that for his 50th birthday, he was going to do 50 pushups. Hunter told him that if he can do 50, he could probably do 100. “He told me I’d blown his mind. He was a sports psychologist, and he never had the gall to consider that he might do that.” He ended up doing 200 pushups, and half of the effort was just deciding that he could, she says.“The reason why most people cannot do pullups is that they do not practice pullups,” says Smith, the former Navy SEAL. Posey adds that the problem with pullup-assist machines and other exercises is that they don’t fully replicate the motor pattern of an actual pullup.Posey’s pullup training guide outlines about a dozen pullup-based exercises, but she has helped hundreds of people achieve pullups with a training plan that consists of just a few simple exercises — essentially just different ways of practicing pullups. (Posey is expecting her first child in a few months and soon will be updating her pullup manifesto to include advice for doing pullups during pregnancy.)Posey’s plan centers around three essential exercises: partner-assisted pullups, “negatives,” and jumping pullups.In the partner-assisted drills, you hang on the bar and initiate a pullup. When you start to falter, your partner helps by spotting you on the middle and upper back (not your feet).In the negative pullup, you stand on a chair or stool to get yourself to the top of the pullup bar and then slowly lower yourself down. This might seem easier than lifting yourself up, Posey says, but it’s a very effective way of getting better at pullups because it’s an eccentric move, which means that your muscle is lengthening. Eccentric exercises stimulate the muscle fibers and nerves and help build strength.In the jumping pullup, you jump up to give yourself a boost at the start and avoid beginning from a dead hang.You can put it all together by doing pullup progressions — sets of pullup exercises that you increase in number over time. The Posey plan involves doing sets of these exercises three to five times per day, three to five times per week. “The goal is to do as many as you can in a particular day without wearing yourself out,” she says.Technique is important, Posey says. Grip the bar tightly with your pinkie knuckle over the top of the bar. Tuck in your pelvis, and keep your abs tight. Pull your arms down into your shoulder sockets, and keep your shoulders down (the opposite of shrugging). Hang your legs straight, and keep your head neutral. As you begin the exercise, keep your abs and glutes tight, and concentrate on pulling your elbows to your ribs and your chin over the bar (don’t lift your chin up).Some of your initial strength gains at the beginning of a training program will actually come from neural changes, says Hunter, the Marquette University exercise scientist. A pullup is a dynamic movement that requires stabilizing the shoulder and recruiting multiple muscles; by practicing the pullup exercise itself, you’re teaching your nervous system how to do the move. “You need a certain amount of coordination and motor control,” Hunter says.Pullup progressions can help people go from zero to one pullup, but they’re also how pullup world record holder John Orth trained for his feat. Orth, a violin builder from Golden, Colorado, holds the record for the most pullups completed in 24 hours: 7,600.Orth set an interval timer to go off every 30 or 40 seconds. Every time it buzzed, he would do a set of six or seven pullups; he continued this for two or three hours per day. On his most serious training days, he’d set the timer for 15 or 20 seconds and do sets at that interval for as long as he was able. Orth supplemented this training with a pullup-assist machine that he would use like a rowing machine, doing pullups at half his body weight for up to an hour straight. He also did pullups with a weight belt. “It made it so that when I wasn’t wearing the weight belt, it made me feel extra light,” he says.This feeling that Orth could rip them out is key, because, as Posey discovered on that fateful day when she achieved her first one, how many pullups you can do—or whether you can do one at all—may be all in your head.Written by"
54,TikTok Is the New Home for Thinspo,"For more information on the novel coronavirus and Covid-19, visit cdc.gov.Towards the end of December, TikTok’s content soundtracked by “All I Want For Christmas” was beginning to wane, and videos focused on weight loss goals for the New Year started to appear.One of the most ubiquitous trends features users creating a “weight loss shake” comprised of cucumber, pineapple, and water. While that might seem like a dangerous concoction even to someone without a background in nutrition, certified nutritionists on TikTok were quick to make split-screen videos outlining just how misguided using the drink as a meal replacement can be.While there is an increasing number of health professionals using their own TikTok videos to spread information about healthy weight loss, users sharing dangerous tips, misguided encouragement, and a fair amount of body-shaming still appear on the platform, reminiscent of #thinspo communities on older social media platforms.#thinspo, online communities championing disordered eating, have been making headlines since the early 2010s, popping up on everything from Tumblr to Pinterest. TikTok content that could fall under this umbrella can sometimes be found under the tag #thinspiration, though other hashtags like #weightloss and #weightlosscheck also feature users outlining daily food habits with very, very low calorie counts. While these tags can also be a place for those who have lost weight in a healthy way to share and celebrate their progress, there are plenty of videos on the platform that champion losing weight fast, seemingly at any cost. And combined, videos posted using those three tags have a combined 2.1 billion views.According to TikTok’s recently-updated community guidelines, “Content that promotes eating habits that are likely to cause health issues is also not allowed on the platform.” Forbidden content includes“pro-ana or other dangerous behavior to lose weight.”The guidelines make the distinction that content around eating disorder recovery and other forms of support for those in recovery is allowed, and the platform has been a place for eating disorder (ED) survivors to post triumphs and words of support for others. But “thinspiration” content still gets through. TikTok did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.Hannah Magee, a registered dietitian who has been creating TikTok content for about two months, described another troubling meme making the rounds. “I definitely have seen content that glamorizes or normalizes disordered eating among young women, which is really unfortunate.” Magee points to the use of Ke$ha’s ‘Your Love is My Drug’, with its line “Maybe I need some rehab”, as promoting unhealthy behavior. “There were many teens using this audio to share and joke about restricting food, binge-eating and over-exercising.”Magee has noticed more of this troublesome content on TikTok than other social platforms. “From what I’ve seen so far, I think that I’ve seen more disordered or unhealthy content on TikTok in such a short amount of time than other social media platforms that I use,” she said. “That could be due to the fact that I really filter out my Instagram and Twitter pages from any accounts that promote diet culture and disordered behaviors and I find it’s a little harder to that on the For You Page of TikTok.”“As TikTok gets more popular, we will see more and more misinformation being put out”According to Sarah Grace Meckelberg, a registered dietician with a masters in exercise physiology, the main examples of disordered eating content on the platform she’s encountered include videos that showcase severe cases of undereating as well as “weird detox drinks like one with lemon and cucumber.” Beyond critiquing dangerous trends like the cucumber shake in split-screen videos, Mackelberg has also attempted to combat what she describes as “nutrition fake news.”For Brittany Mock, a TikTok user who has a BS and an MS in nutrition and dietetics, user’s comments on certain videos showcase the body-shaming happening on the platform. “I have also noticed several accounts calling out ‘fat people’ stating why they are fat, as if they know the reason without even knowing the person. That is the kind of content we shouldn’t be seeing on social media because we know from research that weight gain and obesity can be due to a variety of reasons. Diet culture is so embedded in our lives, most don’t realize how even subtle comments and actions can affect someone.”Though Mock said when it comes to her TikTok content she’s “absolutely trying to combat diet culture,” she isn’t seeing too much disordered eating content spreading on the platform — for now. “I will say Instagram and Facebook have a lot more unhealthy content on their platforms due to the popularity of them being higher,” Mock said. “I can predict as TikTok gets more popular, we will see more and more misinformation being put out.”Written by"
55,How to Make Your Dreams Come True,"My teacher wants to see me after class.I don’t know why. I have absolutely no idea. I’m 12 years old, and I’m not a troublemaker of any sort. I’m far too shy for that.She scratches her nose as if she’s uncomfortable. It’s hot in the classroom, and I’m uncomfortable too.“Your results came back from the English exam.”I remember that we took an exam a few days ago, an international one. It’s supposed to test our ability in English. All the students speak English — we attend an English-medium school in a former British colony, but we have wildly varying levels of proficiency.She says, as if it were a problem rather than an achievement, “You have a Distinction.”I look at the certificate she hands me. It says my name right there, on top of a scoring key. I see that Distinction is the highest score.“You’re the only student in the class that got Distinction. But don’t think this makes you special.”I am lost, but she continues: “I’ve seen your attitude in class — you’re very arrogant. As arrogant as the devil. I don’t want this to encourage you. You have to learn some humility. You’re not that good.”There’s a few more words, but I don’t hear them. Finally she dismisses me, and I can sense that she is relieved. I walk out of the room clutching my Distinction certificate in small hot hands. Now I know it doesn’t mean anything.Where to begin.We obsess over beginnings. People want a good origin story. They ask this question all the time: When did it begin? They ask this of gay people, of sick people, and of artists. When did you find out? When did it begin? And for me the answer is always “When did what begin? If you mean, when did I start writing, well, I started writing when I was seven years old.”It’s true. I knew I wanted to write from the time I could write. I stole my parents’ office notebooks and wrote poems in them. I still remember lines from one poem: “The lacy little wavelet/On the brown shore.” I remember being inordinately proud of that line.That’s when I started writing, but I never called myself a writer. I was just good at English, that’s all. Writing was something I did for myself. I did it all through high school, and then college, and then law school. I kept journals; I blogged; I tweeted; I wrote jokes on Facebook because I had to write. I dreamed of growing up to be a real writer. I was like Wendy in Peter Pan, not ready to face the heartbreak of being grown up.It’s an interesting question: this question of who gets to call themselves a “real writer.” Is it a good or bad thing? Why do twentysomething white girls on Thought Catalog declare with swagger, “I’m working on my first book about New York,” when Haruki Murakami says that being a writer is kind of embarrassing? What mysterious world divides those two?The problem with hard work is that it’s fundamentally boring to talk about.Some say you’re a real writer when you get paid for writing. Most people would agree that you can call yourself a writer when you’ve been published. I blew past both those milestones and still didn’t call myself a writer. Like Murakami, I disliked the very word. When people said of me, she writes, I said, “I’m a lawyer.” I didn’t want to seem foolish. Writers were people like John Steinbeck and Ernest Hemingway: meaty, big, important. Writers were not alright at writing. Writers were very, very, very good.For a while, I was obsessed with talent shows. There’s this talent show called The Voice. It’s a pretty cheesy show, to be honest. Hopeful people come from all over America, from New York and Massachusetts and small towns in the Midwest. People with real careers already, grown-ups. They walk onto a stage — the judges are sitting with their backs to the contestants, so they have no idea what they look like. Then the spotlight comes up, and they begin to sing.If a judge likes their voice, they hit a button that turns their chair around. That moment, when the chair turns around, is the main reason I watch the show. The expression on the face of the contestant — rich, complicated, joy struggling with disbelief — is one we are rarely allowed to witness.For contestants on The Voice, it’s a moment of vindication. Somebody, Somebody Who Mattered, has told them they are a real singer.Artists often talk about that moment. It’s a dream: to be “discovered” the same way a talent scout may see a sulky, skinny 14-year-old in the mall and realize she has the face of a supermodel. To be a young Roald Dahl sending a famous writer notes on his story only to hear “You’ve written my story already. Did you know you were a writer?”Of course, it rarely happens that way. It’s more likely to happen like it happened to J.K. Rowling, who struggled through rejections from so many publishers before one agreed to take on Harry Potter.Step Two: Being good with rejection.It’s deep winter in Massachusetts, and all around me the sky is gray. I’m sitting in my college advisor’s office, and he’s telling me that he’ll look at my work.“I’m going to tell you the truth,” he warns, twinkling at me from behind his desk. “Some people don’t want to hear the truth. But I’ll tell it to you. I can’t lie about your writing. I know when something’s not good.”I am amused. “Have you ever been wrong?”“Like, for instance, Sylvia Plath’s ‘Daddy’ is not a good poem.”“Really? Sylvia Plath’s ‘Daddy’? Really?”“Answer me this: what’s it about? What do all those extravagant words mean? That mess of stark images?”I thought quickly. “Well, it’s about her troubled relationship with her father, who she sees as a kind of Nazi figure in her life, right?”“Yeah, but what does it mean to say The black telephone’s off at the root? What, exactly, does that mean?”I’m confused. “I think it means that he can’t influence her anymore.”“You think, but you’re not sure. Which is why it’s not a great poem.”I don’t want to challenge him. I don’t yet have the entitlement to challenge people on their opinions. It will take me many more years, many long and painful years, to learn the first rudiments of it.“So? Will you show me your work?”With a smile, I decline. I hurry out of his office.If this man, this confident white man in his office knows that Sylvia Plath is not a great poet, what would he make of me? I cannot imagine.There’s a lot of talk about hard work, too.The problem with hard work is that it’s fundamentally boring to talk about. When Biggie raps “Birthdays was the worst days / Now we sip champagne when we’re thirsty,” we’re enraptured by his vision, by the romance of it, of going from nothing to something. It has to feel like a dream to us: It can’t feel like someone laying brick patiently over brick and announcing one day, Here is my house. Which is, sadly, how these things happen.It’s true that there is no substitute for talent. But talent without hard work is nothing, nothing at all. It flares briefly and explodes in the grey world, and afterward we are not sure if it was anything at all.I remember interviewing a woman who had worked with Michael Jackson, a musician, and I remember her telling me how hard he worked.“He’s the hardest working man I ever met in my life,” she said. “My whole life long. He was in the studio before other people and he was there long after other people left.”I wondered why he had to work that hard if he was Michael Jackson. It didn’t occur to me that he had to work that hard because he was Michael Jackson.Talent without hard work is nothing, nothing at all. It flares briefly and explodes in the grey world, and afterward we are not sure if it was anything at all.It is nearly summer.I am sitting in front of yet another teacher. This one is a guidance counselor at my boarding school.We are playing the old, old, game of “Guess What Will Happen to Everybody When They Grow Up.”Some kids get doctors, some get engineers, and some get lingerie designers. (My teacher likes to get creative.)It’s my turn. She looks at me speculatively and says “This one will be a housewife. She’ll have two kids by the time she’s 25.”I know she doesn’t mean it unkindly. In fact, she thinks it’s a compliment. I’m so shy, so painfully awkward in my adolescence, that she sees nothing special in me. She imagines my dreams to be narrow, circumscribed by my circumstances.Her words are burning in me, red and large like flowers. I will never forget them, I tell myself. I never do.There is a point to all these stories, I promise. I’m getting to it.If you have the genuine disease — if you are an honest-to-goodness dreamer — you have to understand a few things. The life is filled with people saying No to you. If you’re a woman, if you’re brown, many more people will say No to you. Many people will not believe that you’re special. They will tell you that you’re not special. Unless you have the kind of entitlement that comes with being rich, white, and having supportive parents, you will believe them. You will not have the audacity to move to New York at 20 to work on your first book. You would not dare.It will come slow to you, agonizingly slow. (There’s a phrase in India for people like this: strugglers. Strugglers are people who want to become famous actors. It’s the most appropriate word to describe their lives.)You will not quit your job right away. Maybe you will never be lucky enough to quit. Maybe you will have to work nights and weekends and lunch breaks, with no sexy Hollywood montage to speed things up.You have to own the shame and struggle of being an artist, and try not to listen when people laugh — because people will laugh.Hardest of all to hear, most painful, is this: Maybe the moment will never come. Strugglers are often doomed. Is that what you wanted to hear? It’s not, but what choice do you have?You have to wake up every day, every single day, and build your sandcastle with aching hands, with your aching raw hands. You have to own the shame and struggle of being an artist, and try not to listen when people laugh — because people will laugh. Worse: they will pity you, the way they pity people who link to their Soundcloud under Nicki Minaj videos.Nobody ever believes it until you get your book deal, your record deal, your movie deal. You will be the only one that believes it right until it happens. What choice do you have?In the end, I decided that you’re a writer when, in the words of Rainer Maria Rilke, you “would die if you were forbidden to write.” If you must write. That is the answer. Sweet, aching, satisfying and heartbreaking as it is to hear, that is the only answer.Written by"
56,Why Long Walks Will Change Your Life,"I am back home for Christmas, and yesterday, on Boxing Day, I walked in the rain from my village and down into the valley, then upwards and into the woodlands. This is my childhood village — a village called Shelley in the West Riding of Yorkshire. One woodland stands above and another at the bottom of the valley. On either side of the village, farmlands blanket endless rolling hills. A patchwork of green fields bordered by hedgerows and drystone walls cut across the landscape in every direction. Wildflowers and farm animals (mostly cows or sheep) abound, and the picture is dotted with the occasional ancient farmhouse or barn.The late sun spilled light through the trees and onto the footpath, and every so often a grey squirrel would scurry across my path and ascend the nearest tree until out of sight. Whenever you walk into the woods it feels as if you have entered a sanctuary — everything you think matters does not seem to matter all that much under the shelter of the trees. Trees are mysterious to me, like gods or mystics, infinitely wiser than humans, all-knowing, all-seeing, and we can only admire them from below.I could have walked anywhere: along the roads, over the green fields, across the towns and cities — but I always choose the woodlands. In the woods, I walk amongst my ancestors, and I am home. Even in childhood, the woods were where I felt closest to nature’s awe-inspiring workings.I most enjoy woodlands which are unkempt, with fallen trees and branches on the ground, brushes and brambles in sprawl, and no clear footpath. You have to find your own way through a deadly labyrinth of nettles, thorns, spines, and prickles. These wild woodlands are a fascinating reminder of what nature was like before humanity: a tangled, prickly, and venomous darkness, often hostile and sinister, but at the same time mysteriously beautiful. The wildest things are the most alive, and finding yourself amid the wilderness in an age when man has subdued every other part of life is refreshing.After some time walking along the narrow woodland path, I came across a lonely stream, which flowed through the heart of the woodlands and down the valley. A father watched over his young daughter, a happy, blonde girl, as she played with twigs and sticks and hopped across the stones that sat on the water. I smiled at the father, lunged over the water, and went onward through the trees. Some distance later, the trees stopped before a train track, which stretched across into the distance in a perfect straight line, headed in both directions for the industrial cities of Yorkshire. When I re-entered the woodlands, I was absorbed once again by the trees, the leaves, the sprays of sunlight, the crawling insects, the wet mud — the simple and forgotten things — and carried on toward the village.During my walks, I am in a constant, slow-burning rapture.Eventually, after about an hour and a half of walking, I reached the end of the footpath: a cricket pitch at the top of a hill in a village called Shepley — the name deriving from the Old English sceap (sheep) and leah (clearing), thus meaning “a clearing or meadow where sheep are kept.” At this point, I had a view of the entire landscape, including a full scope of my village on the hillside opposite. Beyond the village, I could see yet more farmlands and woodlands, a Victorian village church, Emmanuel Church, and in the far distance, Emley Moor, a broadcasting tower that pierces through the sky and watches over every village southeast of Huddersfield.Over the years, I must have walked this same route a thousand times, yet I’ve never tired of its charms. If one is attentive enough, every walk is an opportunity to see new sights and hear new sounds. On many occasions, I walked off the track and ended up in some unfamiliar landscape I never could have imagined. For the most part, the landscape of West Yorkshire is not very diverse; it’s mostly green fields and green hills that seem to stretch on forever. But on my local walks, I am an explorer, a pioneer, I am involved in the landscapes, and I notice the wonderful capabilities of the landscape to bend and fold over short distances. I learn the shapes and curves of different trees and plants, and I notice how they change throughout each season. On my walks I am in a constant, slow-burning rapture.Usually, I walk without a plan. I have nothing to achieve; the beauty is in the walking, in the journey itself. I depend on instinct and walk interminably, one foot in front of the other, breathing in the cold air, marveling at the stature of the oak trees, nodding and greeting the dog walkers who pass me by. And then, quite suddenly, ideas arrive. Stories unfold. Meaning and purpose are restored. Beautiful words, long sentences, poetry and rhyme, answers to dreaded questions — these all come in flashing moments when I am absorbed in the landscape, in the eternity of the natural world. It always takes me by surprise, and I often regret not carrying a notepad to write my thoughts down; I just have to hope I will remember everything when I get back home.In nature, you leave yourself behind. You are nobody in the woods. When faced with a particularly difficult problem, I find it’s always healthier to just get out of the house and go for a walk rather than trying to force the answer. For in the repetition of walking you empty yourself out, free yourself of opinion and expectation, and embody once again humanity’s innate character. In this state of emptiness, your mind begins to clear — and then the gods descend to fill the void. Freedom of movement stimulates the mind, bringing forth divine wisdom. A free body is a free mind; which is why, I suppose, the powers that be prefer we sit in offices and cubicles day and night, so that we are made forever stupid and loyal customers.In nature, you leave yourself behind.Indeed, like everyone else, I have days that require I sit inside the office or the library all day and work until the end. And on these days I always feel as if there is a small stove slowly burning in my stomach, a hollow pain, which grows fierier the longer I stifle my vitality. If evening comes and I have not walked far at all, then this fire cannot be contained and it becomes impossible to remain sitting still. I get so anxious that I cannot concentrate on even the simplest of tasks. My mind is exhausted but my body’s energy is idle and unsatisfied. If this energy does not find release through physical exertion, it seeps into the mind and transforms into worries, doubts, fears — what’s more, I can’t sleep, because the untapped life force whirls and spins around my mind, desperately trying to exert itself, keeping me awake. The life force I should be expressing through physical exertion turns back on my body and slowly destroys me.I take long walks because I have a body, and if I do not use my body then I become bad-tempered and apathetic. Those who concentrate solely on their intellect and leave the body behind tend to be rigid, stern characters, and unhealthy. As far as I can tell, each of us seems to have a primal drive toward life, which finds its easiest expression in the act of walking, in the act of moving forward through the natural world and marveling at its beauty. In my experience, all anxious and depressive feelings seem to dissipate when walking along a woodland path. And if you walk far enough you eventually achieve a state of joy — a quiet, inner happiness — and you are relieved, as you have escaped the walls, the squares, the eternity of sitting, of stagnation; now you are moving over the landscape, over the hills and far away, fighting against gravity, breathing fresh air, with a pulsing heart and an appetite for flowers and sunlight. You are free in search of the springs of life. A long walk is a rebirth of consciousness; one never returns quite the same, and is always better off for it.Written by"
57,Automated Keyword Extraction from Articles using NLP,"In research & news articles, keywords form an important component since they provide a concise representation of the article’s content. Keywords also play a crucial role in locating the article from information retrieval systems, bibliographic databases and for search engine optimization. Keywords also help to categorize the article into the relevant subject or discipline.Conventional approaches of extracting keywords involve manual assignment of keywords based on the article content and the authors’ judgment. This involves a lot of time & effort and also may not be accurate in terms of selecting the appropriate keywords. With the emergence of Natural Language Processing (NLP), keyword extraction has evolved into being effective as well as efficient.And in this article, we will combine the two — we’ll be applying NLP on a collection of articles (more on this below) to extract keywords.In this article, we will be extracting keywords from a dataset that contains about 3,800 abstracts. The original dataset is from Kaggle — NIPS Paper. Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) is one of the top machine learning conferences in the world. This dataset includes the title and abstracts for all NIPS papers to date (ranging from the first 1987 conference to the current 2016 conference).The original dataset also contains the article text. However, since the focus is on understanding the concept of keyword extraction and using the full article text could be computationally intensive, only abstracts have been used for NLP modelling. The same code block can be used on the full article text to get a better and enhanced keyword extraction.The dataset used for this article is a subset of the papers.csv dataset provided in the NIPS paper datasets on Kaggle. Only those rows that contain an abstract have been used. The title and abstract have been concatenated after which the file is saved as a tab separated *.txt file.As we can see, the dataset contains the article ID, year of publication and the abstract.Before we proceed with any text pre-processing, it is advisable to quickly explore the dataset in terms of word counts, most common and most uncommon words.The average word count is about 156 words per abstract. The word count ranges from a minimum of 27 to a maximum of 325. The word count is important to give us an indication of the size of the dataset that we are handling as well as the variation in word counts across the rows.A peek into the most common words gives insights not only on the frequently used words but also words that could also be potential data specific stop words. A comparison of the most common words and the default English stop words will give us a list of words that need to be added to a custom stop word list.Sparsity: In text mining, huge matrices are created based on word frequencies with many cells having zero values. This problem is called sparsity and is minimized using various techniques.Text pre-processing can be divided into two broad categories — noise removal & normalization. Data components that are redundant to the core text analytics can be considered as noise.Handling multiple occurrences / representations of the same word is called normalization. There are two types of normalization — stemming and lemmatization. Let us consider an example of various versions of the word learn — learn, learned, learning, learner. Normalisation will convert all these words to a single normalised version — “learn”.Stemming normalizes text by removing suffixes.Lemmatisation is a more advanced technique which works based on the root of the word.The following example illustrates the way stemming and lemmatisation work:To carry out text pre-processing on our dataset, we will first import the required libraries.Removing stopwords: Stop words include the large number of prepositions, pronouns, conjunctions etc in sentences. These words need to be removed before we analyse the text, so that the frequently used words are mainly the words relevant to the context and not common words used in the text.There is a default list of stopwords in python nltk library. In addition, we might want to add context specific stopwords for which the “most common words” that we listed in the beginning will be helpful. We will now see how to create a list of stopwords and how to add custom stopwords:We will now carry out the pre-processing tasks step-by-step to get a cleaned and normalised text corpus:Let us now view an item from the corpus:We will now visualize the text corpus that we created after pre-processing to get insights on the most frequently used words.Text in the corpus needs to be converted to a format that can be interpreted by the machine learning algorithms. There are 2 parts of this conversion — Tokenisation and Vectorisation.Tokenisation is the process of converting the continuous text into a list of words. The list of words is then converted to a matrix of integers by the process of vectorisation. Vectorisation is also called feature extraction.For text preparation we use the bag of words model which ignores the sequence of the words and only considers word frequencies.As the first step of conversion, we will use the CountVectoriser to tokenise the text and build a vocabulary of known words. We first create a variable “cv” of the CountVectoriser class, and then evoke the fit_transform function to learn and build the vocabulary.Let us now understand the parameters passed into the function:An encoded vector is returned with a length of the entire vocabulary.We can use the CountVectoriser to visualise the top 20 unigrams, bi-grams and tri-grams.The next step of refining the word counts is using the TF-IDF vectoriser. The deficiency of a mere word count obtained from the countVectoriser is that, large counts of certain common words may dilute the impact of more context specific words in the corpus. This is overcome by the TF-IDF vectoriser which penalizes words that appear several times across the document. TF-IDF are word frequency scores that highlight words that are more important to the context rather than those that appear frequently across documents.TF-IDF consists of 2 components:Based on the TF-IDF scores, we can extract the words with the highest scores to get the keywords for a document.Ideally for the IDF calculation to be effective, it should be based on a large corpora and a good representative of the text for which the keywords need to be extracted. In our example, if we use the full article text instead of the abstracts, the IDF extraction would be much more effective. However, considering the size of the dataset, I have limited the corpora to just the abstracts for the purpose of demonstration.This is a fairly simple approach to understand fundamental concepts of NLP and to provide a good hands-on practice with some python codes on a real-life use case. The same approach can be used to extract keywords from news feeds & social media feeds.Written by"
58,How to write with artificial intelligence,"In the past few days, I’ve taught a machine learning algorithm how to write in the style of Harry Potter, Hamilton (the musical), and HBO’s Silicon Valley. The mostly non-sensical, occasionally human-like, topically-flavored writing seems to be amusing not only to me, but to many others.“Dumbledore will get out from behind a cream cake” — Harry Potter: Written by Artificial IntelligenceThus, I’ve made this quick tutorial to teach you how to create your own instances of “Deep Writing”. This is not going to be an in-depth description of the underlying technology — but instead, a step-by-step guide that anybody can follow (even if you have no coding or machine learning experience).Here is a very crude approximation of what is involved in the Deep Writing process. More than anything, this is meant to give you enough intuition and appreciation to follow along with the rest of the tutorial.We are going to use code written by Sung Kim (who teaches computer science at HKUST). This code is very similar to the code I used, but is a little bit more generally applicable.Visit this link, click on the green “Clone or download button”, and then choose “Download Zip”.Find the zip file in your downloads folder, and double-click to unzip it. Drag the folder to your desktop.Open the file input.txt, which you can find in word-rnn-tensorflow-master > data > tinyshakespeare > input.txt. Then, delete all the text in the file, and replace it with the sample text that you want to use. Make sure you save the updated file.This sample text is the text that your algorithm will read and use as inspiration. For example, you can use the text of Harry Potter, the lyrics to Hamilton, the scripts from Silicon Valley, and so on.The longer the sample text, the “better” the output will be. Of course, the longer the sample text, the longer it will take to train your model. For comparison, the Harry Potter sample text was 467,678 words long.TensorFlow is a machine learning library made by Google. We need to download it in order to run our code.To do this, we will use the Terminal. To open the Terminal, click command + space, which will open “Spotlight Search”. Type “Terminal” and click enter.The terminal should open.Copy and paste the following line into the Terminal and click enter.Then, copy and paste this next line and click enter.These two line prepare your system to install TensorFlow.Then, copy the below line into the Terminal and click enter. This identifies which version of TensorFlow you want to install.Copy this final line and click enter. This will start the installation.After a few minutes, the installation will finish and you can now use TensorFlow on your computer.With TensorFlow downloaded on your computer, it’s time to train your model (i.e. “group” words based on patterns).To start, we want to let the computer know that we want to use TensorFlow. Copy and paste the line below into the Terminal and click enter.Now, we want to run the training file. To do this, we first need to tell the Terminal where the file is. Copy and paste the below line and click enter.Lastly, start the training file by copying and pasting the following line into the Terminal. Click enter and the training will begin.Training will take many hours (especially if your sample text is large). It will also drain your battery really fast, so make sure your computer is plugged in. While training, do not close the Terminal window and do not close your computer.Once your model finishes training, it’s finally time to create the Deep Writing.To prepare, open the file sample.py, which lives inside the folder word-rnn-tensorflow-master. Inside of the file, search for the line of code that says:Change the default value to the number of words you want in your instance of Deep Writing. I recommend something between 1000 and 2000.Once you make the change, save the updated file.Then, go back to the Terminal and copy and paste the following code.It will take a minute or two, and then the computer will spit out a beautiful instance of Deep Writing.With a little bit of formatting, it’s ready to be published.I created a publication on Medium to collect interesting examples of Deep Writing. If you create Deep Writing that you want to share, Tweet me a link, and I’ll added it the publication.If you are interested in learning more deeply about machine learning and the underlying math, here’s a good place to start.Written by"
59,Kakeibo: The Japanese Art Of Saving Money,"By Jacqui AgateSaving money is hard. Really, really hard. However much you feel you’re scrimping, you’re always left with nothing more than a few pitiful pounds rattling around your account at the end of the month, right? We hear you.A huge chunk of your pay probably goes on rent, and then there are the bills and travel costs that eat away your precious pennies without you even noticing.Then there’s that voice. That tiny, niggling voice at the back of your mind that says: “Why bother? You’ll never afford a house anyway. Treat yourself to that coconut flat white from Pret. You deserve it.”Enter the kakeibo, a “budgeting journal” and the latest Japanese lifestyle trend to get people talking. The kakeibo was invented back in 1904 by Hani Motoko, Japan’s first female journalist, and was designed to help busy women keep on top of their finances. Now, the first English-language kakeibo, by writer Fumiko Chiba, has just been released, so it’s time to put it to work.The concept goes like this: At the start of each month, you sit down with your kakeibo and you plan what you’re going to spend, what you’re going to save and what you need to do to reach your goals. You then review what you’ve achieved. Sound simple? It is.Here’s what you need to know:1. We need to shift our focus from saving to spendingNo problem, we hear you say. Spending is not the issue. Then you’ll like this.Chiba explains that we need to reshape our attitude towards budgeting — we must “spend well” in order to “save well” and vice versa.“We all work very hard in order to live, and also to enjoy things,” Chiba tells us. “It’s important to remember this fact when saving.”In other words, if saving is all about what we can’t do and can’t have, it’s a chore, and we’ll likely quit. If it becomes about budgeting meticulously so we can do and can have what we really want, it becomes a much more inviting prospect.2. Writing things down will helpKeeping a kakeibo is all about recording your spending, but it’s not enough to plug numbers into a spreadsheet. Putting pen to paper is a fundamental part of the practice.“So much of our lives is lived on our phones or on computer screens,” Chiba says. “[Recording our finances online] mimics the instantaneous way we spend money. The journal is one remove from this, and it gives us the space and time to look at our spending in detail.”In this sense, Chiba says, using a kakeibo becomes a kind of mindfulness exercise. “Our world is now so fast that everything can be bought and paid for very quickly. A kakeibo helps us slow down and really consider what we buy in a calm, measured way.”So at the beginning of the month, you need to figure out and write down how much money you actually have. Look at what you’ve got, from your salary to any freelance bits to that £20 of birthday money from your mum, and tot it all up.Then take your “fixed expenditure”: the stuff you have to pay, like rent and bills, and take it away from your total amount. Easy enough.This will leave you with a sum that you can choose to “save” or “spend well”. Don’t worry if it’s in single figures right now — we’re just getting started.3. You need to be honest about your “musts” and “wants”Using a kakeibo is about decluttering your finances. If you’ve followed the last step, you know how much money is coming in, and you know what has to go out — so it’s time to figure out how you’re spending the rest, and the ways you can do it better.The kakeibo works by dividing your spending into categories and getting really specific about it. For example: one category could be takeaways. The things listed here could run the gamut from a full-blown Deliveroo night to a quick takeaway coffee that slipped your mind as soon as you’d guzzled it. Be rigorous.Once you know where your money’s going, you can sort your “musts” from your “wants”: what you absolutely need, and what you can survive without. Sure, we all need to eat — that’s a “must”. But let’s be honest, that lunchtime Itsu habit is a big old want. And sure, clothes are a “must” too — but does that really equate to spending all your spare money in Topshop?Chiba advises: “To realise your ‘musts’, write down things that would go wrong if you did not spend money on them — these are usually costs that do not go away from month to month, like food.”By looking at your spending in chunks (rather than a never-ending, guilt-inducing list of outgoings), you can identify the areas you may be able to cut back.4. Cash is better than cardNowadays, we’re more likely to have a wad of cards than cash (we wish) in our purse. But this, Chiba tells Refinery29, could be where we’re going wrong. Using a card makes us less accountable for our spending, while the physical act of handing over cash is something we’re more likely to think twice about.Chiba even suggests taking cash out of the bank and dividing it into labelled envelopes to help you keep within your limits.“For me the physical placing of cash in envelopes makes you less likely to spend it on other things, like drinks with your friends,” she explains. “Small acts can make a big difference in your saving goals. Acting with patience and consistency is what the kakeibo encourages.”5. You should finish the month by reflecting on your progressA glimpse at your mobile-banking app (followed by a cold sweat when you spy single figures) won’t cut it. At the end of each month, your kakeibo demands that you scrutinise your past four weeks of spending, acknowledging successes and weaknesses, and setting goals for the following month.Tracking spending in apps just shows us where we’re going wrong, Chiba says. But by using a kakeibo, you can get a broader perspective.“I find joy in saving small amounts every month. They seem like nothing at the time, but lead to a bigger total in the end,” she explains. “Your review period keeps you reminded of this progress.”So get yourself a kakeibo, get scribbling and don’t forget to give yourself a pat on the back after a month well spent.Kakeibo: The Japanese Art of Saving Money is available in the UK now.Originally published at https://refinery29.com.Written by"
60,Making Money Online is Easier than You Think. Here’s Why,"Many people like to write articles like, “How to Make $1,000 Per Month Online.” Or, “This One Trick Will Make You a Digital Millionaire!”However, they're missing an important point: Rather than focusing on making a thousand or a million dollars, you should simply be focused on making a start.As Chris Guillebeau writes in his book, The Art of Non-Conformity,“If you can find a way to make $1,000 a month on your own, you can usually find a way to make $5,000.”Indeed, more important than making $1,000, is making your first dollar. It’s about creating a runway and getting a start from which you can build.Once you get your ideas off the ground, then the rest becomes so much easier.So, with that, the remainder of this article will explore how you do it.Here we go:“It’s impossible to create work that both matters and pleases everyone.” -Seth GodinOf course, Facebook started out as just a platform designed to connect Harvard students with one another.Indeed, it was not Zuckerberg’s original plan to create a product that would attract more than 2 billion active users, but rather, to simply get all his classmates to sign up.Mailchimp was born as CEO and Co-Founder, Ben Chestnut couldn’t be bothered to individually design email newsletters for a stream of clients who wanted them.Thus, he created a tool that would take care of the process for him. Fast-forward to today, and Mailchimp is now an email newsletter service worth over 4 billion dollars.The lesson?Focus on creating a product that scratches the itch for a small group of people, and if it’s truly worth caring about, then more people will come.For example, I write my articles to the person I was 2 years ago. The one who was addicted to video games, had no real direction in life, and simply needed some encouragement.I’m not trying to force out any topics that I don’t agree with myself, and thus, it often resonates.Hence, if you’re not seeing the results you want, perhaps it’s time to look for a different and smaller audience. However, don’t also forget to have a long term vision. Which takes us to the next point:“Before you ever reach a goal, already have the next mountain or two in mind.” -Benjamin P. HardyIn his book, Zero to One, Peter Thiel explains that when Yahoo! offered to buy Facebook for $1 billion in July 2006, Zuckerberg didn't even consider it. Instead, saying that it was merely a formality.Hence, Peter Thiel further wrote:“Mark saw where he could take the company, and Yahoo! didn’t. A business with a good definite plan will always be underrated in a world where people see the future as random.”Indeed, no matter where you currently are. No matter how good or bad your business is currently doing, you must have a vision of something more.You must see where you want to go in your mind and heart and then work towards it in the here and now.Hence, my frequent recommendation is to “Think Big, Go Small.” Start with a crazy vision of who you are and where you want to be, and then bring your actions back to reality.It is small, consecutive steps that lead to big success.“Most people would rather make a million dollars in their head every night than $100 dollars in cash every day.” -George Horace LorimerMost people will continue to read about how to make a thousand or a million dollars online and then continue to wonder why they aren't getting anywhere.However, the solution is simple: Make the steps smaller! Of course, Brain Tracy has said,“Any goal can be achieved if you break it down into enough small parts.”Indeed, it shouldn’t be about making $1,000 but your first dollar, and the one after that and the one after that — each success leads to the next.They say simply getting a rocket off the ground is the hardest part, and making money online is the same.Once your ideas start taking off, then nothing becomes impossible.Like this article?

61,"I’m 80 Years Old And Help, I’ve Fallen — Into A Trap","People say I am a positive, optimistic person who acts and looks a bit younger than my age. I pursue the things that interest me in my life. Plus, as long as my supply of Tylenol and CBD lotion holds out, I can ignore my arthritis. In other words, I’m blessed with good health, considering what some people have to face at this age.But I have a little beef with myself this morning. I’m shocked to discover I’ve unconsciously succumbed to negative stereotypes about aging that I consciously resist.I’m going to cut myself some slack because I doubt there’s a demographic out there that doesn’t have to push back against some type of naysaying. I’m sure even the one-percenters deep down have doubts and fears that all their money and power can’t assuage.It’s the nature of life on this planet, of that I’m convinced, to fight demons and overcome them, only to find others lying in wait. If you struggle to reach an ideal weight or body mass if you’re a guy, believing life will be golden when you reach your goal, bam. No such luck. You get there, if you’re lucky, and then career or family or financial issues raise their ugly heads.Yeah, there’s always something ready to take down your good feelings about yourself. In my case, I’ve spent many years fighting the challenges to my self-worth. I came of age at a time when women were considered good for childbearing and housecleaning and not much else. At least in the business world.I’m not whining about that. It’s simply the way it was. I figured out my own work-around, as many women have. I’ve pursued goals such as writing that shocked my parents, aunts, and uncles of the previous generation.But our youth-centric culture got to me. Recently, I stepped on the scale and found the reason my jeans had gotten a bit tight. Yeah, I needed to lose some weight. Nothing major. Ten pounds or so will do it.Then this sneaky voice whispered in my ear. What does it matter? I’m old now. Who cares what I look like.Yeah, me, who rails about people assuming octogenarians are only good for playing bingo and watching cat videos, knowing folks my age are still rocking it and then some.But, lo and behold, ageist thinking had its claws in me. How else can I explain going out in public without makeup, in my old sneakers and a jacket to cover my sagging T-shirt. Not that it’s important to dress up for a trip to pick up a prescription at CVS. It’s just, that’s not me. Or it didn’t use to be me.I’d always have time to pull on a decent pair of jeans and a sweater, then slap on a dab of lipstick to run an errand. Sunglasses? They were to shield my eyes, not to hide behind in case I ran into a neighbor, hoping nobody would recognize me in my grubby look. My sloppy duds were good enough now because I was old. Who would look at me? Who would care?If I couldn’t swan down the avenue in heels and a smile painted in a killer red lipstick, why bother?I’ve always hated that message. In many ways, I’ve succeeded in taking it down for the count. But a piece I wrote last week about coffee and refusing leftovers opened my eyes.I began to see I’ve adopted a bias against my age. I‘m making assumptions that some things don’t matter because of my age. These notions have crept into my subconsciousness, even though my public stance hasn’t changed.But that’s how they work, these signals that we’re not good enough because of the color of our skin, the size and shape of our bodies, our gender, sexual orientation, or some other aspect of our being. Things we can’t do anything about, even if we wanted to: like age.We unconsciously absorb, like the soot we breathe in a smoggy city, noxious beliefs that bombard us from every side. The subtle and sometimes overt messaging sent through social media, or bullying tactics in school, and especially marketing strategies that shine a positive light on one group at the expense of another.I’m looking at you fashion and cosmetics industries.If we’re the target, it’s hard not to buy into the idea that we’re not good enough. As soon as those messages hit us, well, you might as well sign up with a therapist right then and there, because it will take a lifetime to undo that damage.I’ve made it my mission to signal aging isn’t a curse. That there’s life after Medicare. Certainly, that’s true inmy case. Except for a more energetic and pain-free body, at 80, there isn’t much I long for from my youth. Many if not most of my peers say the same thing.Every age comes with conflict and stress. You can’t always see the rewards of time spent consciously growing and learning and getting past obstacles and even trauma until you’re older. And that’s what I’ve got, what’s made my aging so much better than my youth. More confidence and ease with myself.But the work is never done. As if somebody turned up the volume, I hear messages in my head that shock me. I should get rid of my possessions because why do I need cookbooks and jewelry and a whole set of baking utensils if I’m too old to really use them? Throw away my hiking boots because I’ll never climb a mountain again. Not because I don’t want to. I’m too old, I think.Sometimes my younger friends drive home that point. They practically want to carry me from one side of the living room to the other when I visit, apparently worried you lose your ability to walk and talk at the same time when you turn 80.Maybe I don’t need all the things in my apartment, but I love many of them. Why do I have to arbitrarily choose between the practicality of a purge and the heartache of ending important chapters of my life like some writers urge?So my worth isn’t measured in whether I wear makeup everyday. But do I have to sacrifice my self-image and interest in fashion because I’ve become invisible to youngsters and marketers after a certain age?My activist octogenarian says no. Yet, why do all but throw a bag over my head instead of getting dressed a little nicer every day. It’s not that I don’t have the clothes or cosmetics. I like to look at myself all prettied up in the mirror.I’m coming to a new realization. I’ve been looking at things inside out. I’m too caught up in age. Latching onto a belief at times that I must gauge what’s still available to me in life based on my age. Have I really reached the cut-off point for mindless joy and what a former neighbor scathingly called female frippery?Tell that to Iris Apfel, the 96-year-old force of nature that has her own Iris barbie. Or Amazing Style, the website that photographs older women who dress to the nines every day just because.It’s time to stop defining myself as old. I’m a person, a human. With decisions to make. Do I need certain possessions or should I donate them to make room for something else? Do I want to dress up today or go all comfy in sweats and fuzzy slippers?What I want is what matters. At my age, I’m entitled to that much, at least as long as my body and health hold up. I need to ditch the tag that tells me I’m not allowed to have nice things because I’m officially an elder.I want to be ready in case that photographer comes by, the one who might take my picture when I’m all dressed up and feature it on the Advanced Style blog.Because he’s certainly not going to ask me to pose in stretch pants with the elastic waistband that’s seen better days, the gray roots I’ve stopped touching up. And there’s no good angle he could come up with that would show off for readers looking for a positive role model any negative, ageist thinking.I’m an editor and writer on Medium with Top Writer status.

62,5 Signs You’re Dealing With A Mentally Strong Person,"For so much of my life I thought “strength” was a monolith that housed multiple personality traits under one roof. Assertiveness. Independence. Tenacity. All fantastic traits independently, but together, forming a master quality called *strength.*I was wrong. Strength is of a different constitution altogether.I realized this when I started taking inventory of all the strong people in my life. My 60 year old, sweet and playful mom. My reserved and stoic grandfather. My down-to-earth, yet professional director. There are so many people in my life who I have the privilege of calling strong who share zero personality traits with each other. I mean zero. How could they each be labeled *strong* if they are so categorically different?This led to a discovery. Strength isn’t a personality trait; it’s a frame of mind. It’s a way of seeing yourself and others. It’s an action but also a place. A home that one both inhabits and brings with them wherever they go.Strength is challenging to quantify directly, but we know it when we see it. Here are five of the primary signs of strong people.This is different than name dropping and “collecting” successful people. It means those in their inner circle, their tribe, are successful. I don’t necessarily mean famous. I mean good at what they do. Whether in career or relationships or something else. You see this concept everywhere in the personal growth community. Tony Robbins, Dean Graziosi, and other self-help titans tout the value of masterminds — of intentionally surrounding oneself with successful people on a regular basis to take your life to the next level. The old adage is true: iron does sharpen iron.A mentally weak person cannot have successful friends because it makes them insecure. Weak people must always be the *best* in the posse to gratify their own ego. A mentally strong person holds court with the successful because they are secure in their identity and know this is the only way to grow. If you’re dealing with someone who is surrounded by successful individuals, chances are they are mentally strong.Life is an arena, and most people are spectators. I can’t claim this concept as an original thought. I borrow this metaphor from Theodore Roosevelt:“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again…” — April 23, 1910, Citizenship in a RepublicWhile most people are spectators, there are a rare few who are gladiators. Who step out into the arena. Who put their thoughts out there. Who go after what they want. Who are willing to get ‘marred by dust and sweat and blood’ as Roosevelt says. These are people who start their own company, who write for a living, who public speak, who act/perform or participate in the arts. Such people expose themselves to the scrutiny of others, to the spectators in the arena. Roosevelt’s quote itself links arena-living to strength when it says “how the strong man stumbles.”Willingness to be misunderstood precedes the strong man’s stumbling. Spectators draw their own conclusions about the gladiators, and oftentimes they are wrong. Completely wrong. A weak gladiator will leave the floor and join the spectators in the stands after being misunderstood, maligned, and massacred. A mentally strong person will stay. They are okay with being misunderstood — and everything that comes with it — because they know that it’s part and parcel with success. Greatness is always a few steps after a chorus of who do you think you are?We all have insecurities, doubts, anxieties. A mentally weak person — when confronted with such disappointments — will not lean into vulnerability. Instead, they will act out, withdraw, or feign happiness. Anything but exposing themselves and their thoughts/feelings to people they care about. Like being misunderstood, vulnerability is exposing oneself to the scrutiny of others, but in a different way. It’s leaning into the truth, the insecure parts of us, not knowing if those we love will accept us as we truly are. It’s not spectators we fear in vulnerability, rather our fellow gladiators.I’m currently dating someone right now, and I see this concept as clear as day in the context of the newer relationship. It’s easy for me to speak my mind to any random person on the street. It’s harder to do so, especially if what I’m saying is unfavorable, to my boyfriend. I have much more to lose by sharing my disappointments. It would be far easier to give a half smile or withdraw when my boyfriend does something that bothers me. This is weakness, though. Instead, I must lean into vulnerability — as uncomfortable as it may be — and share what is bothering me in an authentic way. Vulnerability only matters when the relational stakes are high. It is a mark of a strong-minded person who embraces this, even when they would rather run terrified in the other direction (speaking about myself here 😂). I’m not where I want to be in this respect, but I’m trending in the right direction.Have you ever met someone who was just okay with where they are in life, and have never desired to grow or expand as an individual? This type of person baffles me. A mentally weak person has a fixed mindset — they believe they are set in their ways and there is nothing to be done about it. Hence, they don’t even try to grow. A mentally strong person, on the other hand, possesses a growth mindset, a phrase coined by Carol Dweck over 30 years ago.People with a growth mindset believe they can get smarter, and they understand that effort makes them stronger. They believe that with hard work, exemplary instruction, and the right environment they can improve their life. And guess what? Thanks to Michael Merzenich’s neuroplasticity research, we know this is true. Growth mindset aligns with the reality that the brain does change well into adulthood.But why does possessing a growth mindset require strength? Because it starts with an admission that I am not all I want to be (humility) and that I hold the keys to my own improvement (personal responsibility), both of which are markers of the strong-minded.As the Proverb says: “The prudent hold their tongue.” Mentally strong people let others have the last word, even if those “others” are wrong. It is a true sign of security and strength to let someone else shine. To let someone else *own* the moment and take all the glory. Only a secure person who knows their value and isn’t in a comparison game can do this, and not just once, but as a lifestyle. For those who need the last word: Why do you have the need to correct others ad nauseam? What do you stand to gain? Are you that desperate to prove your own worthiness? This is the way of the weak. Being secure in oneself is strength. Affirming others, not self-promotion is strength.Strength is far from what the world teaches us it is. It’s not lifting weights and a keto diet. It’s not a Herculean body frame. In fact, it doesn’t start in the physique — it starts in the mind. Strength is wanting that which is noteworthy and good. Strength is pursuing our dreams at the expense of our ego. Strength is honoring and caring for ourselves and others.When you encounter a strong individual, know that this person didn’t arrive that way by accident. Instead, their strength is a result of the million little decisions, each and every day, to hold court with the successful, to pursue growth, to be misunderstood, to embrace vulnerability, and to let others shine. The mentally strong aren’t a series of pop-up bars — they are long-standing establishments with lifetime patrons.When you find such a person, hold them tight. Wisdom is in their actions. Contentment is in their household. Blessings are in their future.The world does not deserve them.And if you spend any length of time with them, you are struck with the humbling, yet justified, feeling that neither do you.Written by"
63,What It’s Like to Be That Fat Person Sitting Next to You on the Plane,"My breath tightens immediately when the call comes. It’s my boss’s boss, telling me there’s an important meeting in another city. Or maybe it’s a friend, inviting me to her wedding in California. Sometimes, it’s a family member whose health is failing and the time has come to say goodbye.The news hits hard — it’s a high-pressure time for my job, friend, family. My heart is pounding and my breath is tightening. I close my eyes, feel my feet on the ground and my breath in my throat, trying desperately to avoid the embarrassment of a full-blown panic attack at work.I will have to get on a plane. And I am fat.There is a common trope about this very situation, shown frequently on TV, in illustrations, and in casually irritated conversation. Fat people are shown on planes all the time: loud, obnoxious, elbowing people, taking up space, getting Cheetos crumbs all over ourselves and you, our whole existence designed to make you miserable. That caricature doesn’t just hurt when I see it — I crumble under its weight. I am a confident woman with wonderful friends, like you, and a fantastic job. But when I see that caricature of who I’m expected to be, I crumple, sinking quickly into a wave of depression and alienation. It couldn’t be further from my experience.There’s so much that happens before I even buy a ticket. I research policies because every airline has one now for “passengers of size.” All of them include the possibility that I will be charged double, or denied a seat on the plane the day of the flight, leaving me to explain to my boss, partner, friend, family why they won’t be seeing me this week.Southwest famously let director Kevin Smith board, then publicly escorted him off the plane for looking too fat for his seat. United will refuse to board you unless you agree to purchase an additional ticket at the day-of price, and who has $600 to spare? I check first-class prices, where seats are slightly wider and put me at less risk of passenger complaints. $1,000. I move on.The anxiety doesn’t subside once I buy a ticket — it distills, intensifying for weeks leading up to the flight.JetBlue doesn’t have a policy — which means it is the most unsafe of all. I flash back to my last flight on JetBlue, when a passenger loudly complained to a flight attendant while I sat next to him about how he couldn’t be expected to travel like this. She moved him to another seat, switching him with another passenger. She wouldn’t make eye contact with me for the entire flight. Neither would the other passengers in my row. I was so big, and so invisible. This could happen again. I blink back tears.The anxiety doesn’t subside once I buy a ticket — it distills, intensifying for weeks leading up to the flight. I think about how to eliminate every other stressor. Passengers hate it when someone takes too long loading their bag into the overhead compartments. I pay to check a bag so my fellow passengers won’t have additional reasons to complain about me.I practice how I will sit on the plane, pushing my body against the cabin wall, one arm holding the other firmly over my chest, so that I will make no physical contact with the person sitting next to me. I bring mints, so I won’t need anything to drink, and so the flight attendant won’t have to reach across the row for the fat person. I research whether the airports I’ll pass through have a history of confiscating seat belt extenders. If I bring my own, I’ll be spared the white-hot spotlight of asking the flight attendant for one.In the days before the flight, friends tell me I seem distant. A few of my closest friends know that this means I am getting on an airplane. They get quiet, uncertain of what to say or do. The night before the flight, my best friend and I get drinks at a neighborhood bar. Normally, we speak boisterously, laughing uproariously and making friends with other patrons at the bar. Tonight, we don’t say much. Our happy hour ends quickly, and we silently walk home.I don’t sleep that night. At 1:30 a.m., I think about everything I’ve been doing to get healthy. Last month, the doctor said my blood pressure was good, and that I had a healthier exercise regimen than most of the patients she sees. She couldn’t figure out why I was still fat. Neither could I. For nearly a week afterward, I felt inexplicably sad. At 3:00 a.m., I fantasize about what could happen to spare me from the humiliation that feels destined to happen. Maybe if I wear two layers of Spanx, which itch and hurt. Maybe if there’s a surprise snowstorm. Maybe if I start throwing up.Then, in the morning, the airport. The nervous fumbling at security. The uncomfortable lean against the wall at the gate. Scanning other passengers’ faces. Who is friendly? Who else is fat? Is their face knit into knots of worry and hurt? Is mine? I run to the bathroom, lock myself in a stall, and will myself not to vomit.Boarding begins. I line up first, not because I am impatient, but because I’ve selected a window seat, and I want to be settled before anyone else in my row. If I have to step past them, I will hear the familiar, belabored, disdainful sigh. The throat cleared, the muffled groan. These are the sounds of my body being seen in public.I get on the plane, get into my seat, fix my eyes on the baggage handlers below, and avoid interacting with anyone unless they address me first. I grasp my arm and cross my ankles, making my fat body as small as possible. I have carefully observed what makes other passengers snap at fat passengers, roll their eyes, complain to staff. For me, these are inviolable norms.Air travel is sadly familiar, a microcosm of what happens so often as a fat person.Someone pulls out their phone as they pass. I remember the countless, surreptitiously filmed YouTube videos of fat passengers on planes with titles like “Gross Obese Fat People on planes overweight” and “fat man slobbering on airplane, sleeping, snoring, drooling” and “BAN DISGUSTING FATASSES.” I make myself smaller still, doing my best impression of a calm person. There’s nothing to see here. Move along.When the flight takes off, I realize that I’ve done something terrifying, impossible, and ordinary — I have boarded a plane. This time, I won’t have to pay for a second seat, blink back tears in my seat, be escorted from the plane. I’ll arrive.I understand why all of my fellow passengers are on edge. Because everyone is uncomfortable in airplanes. They’re designed to fit as many people as possible — which doesn’t lead to comfortable seats for anyone. Flying is costly, uncomfortable, stressful. Bags get heavy; flights get canceled; relationships get strained. No one, it seems, is having a good time. And at the peak of all that stress — boarding the plane — the person my fellow passengers see is me. Rather than being a compatriot, stuck in the same frustrating, uncomfortable situation, I become a scapegoat for all that frustration. I become the other.In that way, air travel is sadly familiar, a microcosm of what happens so often as a fat person. I am watched — and judged harshly — as I try and fail to fit into a space made for someone else. I am always too big, always too much, always unacceptable. I must make myself smaller and smaller, reducing and reducing endlessly, my stubborn body resisting at every turn. Still, I am never quite small enough to make anyone else comfortable.Before the flight lands, I begin thinking of the return flight. I try to be present with friends & family, try to prep for my work meeting. I use every tool I’ve got to manage my anxiety, my butterfly beating heart and shallow breath and tight shoulders. Despite that, I don’t sleep soundly for days.Written by"
64,Hands-on Machine Learning Model Interpretation,"Interpreting Machine Learning models is no longer a luxury but a necessity given the rapid adoption of AI in the industry. This article in a continuation in my series of articles aimed at ‘Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)’. The idea here is to cut through the hype and enable you with the tools and techniques needed to start interpreting any black box machine learning model. Following are the previous articles in the series in case you want to give them a quick skim (but are not mandatory for this article).In this article we will give you hands-on guides which showcase various ways to explain potential black-box machine learning models in a model-agnostic way. We will be working on a real-world dataset on Census income, also known as the Adult dataset available in the UCI ML Repository where we will be predicting if the potential income of people is more than $50K/yr or not.The purpose of this article is manifold. The first main objective is to familiarize ourselves with the major state-of-the-art model interpretation frameworks out there (a lot of them being extensions of LIME — the original framework and approach proposed for model interpretation which we have covered in detail in Part 2 of this series).We cover usage of the following model interpretation frameworks in our tutorial.The major model interpretation techniques we will be covering in this tutorial include the following.Without further ado let’s get started!We will be using a lot of frameworks and tools in this article given it is a hands-on guide to model interpretation. We recommend you to load up the following dependencies to get the maximum out of this guide!Rememeber to call the shap.initjs() function since a lot of the plots from shap require JavaScript.You can actually get the census income dataset (popularly known as the adult dataset) from the UCI ML repository. Fortunately shap provides us an already cleaned up version of this dataset which we will be using here since the intent of this article is model interpretation.Let’s take a look at the major features or attributes of our dataset.We will explain these features shortly.Let’s view the distribution of people with <= $50K (False) and > $50K (True) income which are our class labels which we want to predict.Definitely some class imbalance which is expected given that we should have less people having a higher income.Let’s now take a look at our dataset attributes and understand their meaning and significance.We have a total of 12 features and our objective is to predict if the income of a person will be more than $50K (True) or less than $50K (False). Hence we will be building and interpreting a classification model.Here we convert the categorical columns with string values to numeric representations. Typically the XGBoost model can handle categorical data natively being a tree-based model so we don’t one-hot encode the features here.Time to build our train and test datasets before we build our classification model.For any machine learning model, we always need train and test datasets. We will be building the model on the train dataset and test the performance on the test dataset. We maintain two datasets (one with the encoded categorical values and one with the original values) so we can train with the encoded dataset but use the original dataset as needed later on for model interpretation.We also maintain our base dataset with the actual (not encoded) values also in a separate dataframe (useful for model interpretation later).We will now train and build a basic boosting classification model on our training data using the popular XGBoost framework, an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable.Here we do the usual, use the trained model to make predictions on the test dataset.Time to put the model to the test! Let’s evaluate how our model has performed with its predictions on the test data. We use my nifty model_evaluation_utils module for this which leverages scikit-learn internally to give us standard classification model evaluation metrics.By default it is difficult to gauge on specific model interpretation methods for machine learning models out of the box. Parametric models like logistic regression are easier to interpret given that the total number of parameters of the model are fixed regardless of the volume of data and one can make some interpretation of the model’s prediction decisions leveraging the parameter coefficients.Non-parametric models are harder to interpret given that the total number of parameters remain unbounded and increase with the increase in the data volume. Some non-parametric models like tree-based models do have some out of the box model interpretation methods like feature importance which helps us in understanding which features might be influential in the model making its prediction decisions.Here we try out the global feature importance calcuations that come with XGBoost. The model enables us to view feature importances based on the following.Note that they all contradict each other, which motivates the use of model interpretation frameworks like SHAP which uses something known as SHAP values, which claim to come with consistency guarantees (meaning they will typically order the features correctly).ELI5 is a Python package which helps to debug machine learning classifiers and explain their predictions in an easy to understand an intuitive way. It is perhaps the easiest of the three machine learning frameworks to get started with since it involves minimal reading of documentation! However it doesn’t support true model-agnostic interpretations and support for models are mostly limited to tree-based and other parametric\linear models. Let’s look at some intuitive ways of model interpretation with ELI5 on our classification model.We recommend installing this framework using pip install eli5 since the conda version appears to be a bit out-dated. Also feel free to check out the documentation as needed.Typically for tree-based models ELI5 does nothing special but uses the out-of-the-box feature importance computation methods which we discussed in the previous section. By default, ‘gain’ is used, that is the average gain of the feature when it is used in trees.One of the best way to explain model prediction decisions to either a technical or a more business-oriented individual, is to examine individual data-point predictions. Typically, ELI5 does this by showing weights for each feature depicting how influential it might have been in contributing to the final prediction decision across all trees. The idea for weight calculation is described here; ELI5 provides an independent implementation of this algorithm for XGBoost and most scikit-learn tree ensembles which is definitely on the path towards model-agnostic interpretation but not purely model-agnostic like LIME.Typically, the prediction can be defined as the sum of the feature contributions + the “bias” (i.e. the mean given by the topmost region that covers the entire training set)Here we can see the most influential features being the Age, Hours per week, Marital Status, Occupation & RelationshipHere we can see the most influential features being the Education, Relationship, Occupation, Hours per week & Marital StatusIt is definitely interesting to see how similar features play an influential role in explaining model prediction decisions for both classes!Skater is a unified framework to enable Model Interpretation for all forms of models to help one build an Interpretable machine learning system often needed for real world use-cases using a model-agnostic approach. It is an open source python library designed to demystify the learned structures of a black box model both globally(inference on the basis of a complete data set) and locally(inference about an individual prediction).Skater originally started off as a fork of LIME but then broke out as an independent framework of it’s own with a wide variety of feature and capabilities for model-agnostic interpretation for any black-box models. The project was started as a research idea to find ways to enable better interpretability(preferably human interpretability) to predictive “black boxes” both for researchers and practitioners.You can typically install Skater using a simple pip install skater. For detailed information on the dependencies and installation instruction check out installing skater.We recommend you to check out the detailed documentation of Skater.Skater has a suite of model interpretation techniques some of which are mentioned below.Since the project is under active development, the best way to understand usage would be to follow the examples mentioned in the Gallery of Interactive Notebook. But we will be showcasing its major capabilities using the model trained on our census dataset.A predictive model is a mapping from an input space to an output space. Interpretation algorithms are divided into those that offer statistics and metrics on regions of the domain, such as the marginal distribution of a feature, or the joint distribution of the entire training set. In an ideal world there would exist some representation that would allow a human to interpret a decision function in any number of dimensions. Given that we generally can only intuit visualizations of a few dimensions at time, global interpretation algorithms either aggregate or subset the feature space.Currently, model-agnostic global interpretation algorithms supported by skater include partial dependence and feature importance with a very new release of tree-surrogates also. We will be covering feature importance and partial dependence plots here.The general workflow within the skater package is to create an interpretation, create a model, and run interpretation algorithms. Typically, an Interpretation consumes a dataset, and optionally some metadata like feature names and row ids. Internally, the Interpretation will generate a DataManager to handle data requests and sampling.We will use the following workflow:Feature importance is generic term for the degree to which a predictive model relies on a particular feature. The skater feature importance implementation is based on an information theoretic criteria, measuring the entropy in the change of predictions, given a perturbation of a given feature. The intuition is that the more a model’s decision criteria depend on a feature, the more we’ll see predictions change as a function of perturbing a feature. The default method used is prediction-variance which is the mean absolute value of changes in predictions, given perturbations in the data.Partial Dependence describes the marginal impact of a feature on model prediction, holding other features in the model constant. The derivative of partial dependence describes the impact of a feature (analogous to a feature coefficient in a regression model). This has been adapted from T. Hastie, R. Tibshirani and J. Friedman, Elements of Statistical Learning Ed. 2, Springer. 2009.The partial dependence plot (PDP or PD plot) shows the marginal effect of a feature on the predicted outcome of a previously fit model. PDPs can show if the relationship between the target and a feature is linear, monotonic or more complex. Skater can show 1-D as well as 2-D PDPsLet’s take a look at how the Age feature affects model predictions.Looks like the middle-aged people have a slightly higher chance of making more money as compared to younger or older people.Let’s take a look at how the Education-Num feature affects model predictions.Looks like higher the education level, the better the chance of making more money. Not surprising!Let’s take a look at how the Capital Gain feature affects model predictions.Unsurprisingly higher the capital gain, the more chance of making money, there is a steep rise in around $5K — $8K.Remember that relationship is coded as a categorical variable with numeric representations. Let’s first look at how it is represented.Let’s now take a look at how the Relationship feature affects model predictions.Interesting definitely that married folks (husband-wife) have a higher chance of making more money than others!We run a deeper model interpretation here over all the data samples, trying to see interactions between Age and Education-Numand also their effect on the probability of the model predicting if the person will make more money, with the help of a two-way partial dependence plot.Interesting to see higher the education level and the middle-aged folks (30–50) having the highest chance of making more money!We run a deeper model interpretation here over all the data samples, trying to see interactions between Education-Num and Capital Gain and also their effect on the probability of the model predicting if the person will make more money, with the help of a two-way partial dependence plot.Basically having a better education and more capital gain leads to you making more money!Local Interpretation could be possibly be achieved in two ways. Firstly, one could possibly approximate the behavior of a complex predictive model in the vicinity of a single input using a simple interpretable auxiliary or surrogate model (e.g. Linear Regressor). Secondly, one could use the base estimator to understand the behavior of a single prediction using intuitive approximate functions based on inputs and outputs.LIME is a novel algorithm designed by Riberio Marco, Singh Sameer, Guestrin Carlos to access the behavior of the any base estimator(model) using interpretable surrogate models (e.g. linear classifier/regressor). Such form of comprehensive evaluation helps in generating explanations which are locally faithful but may not align with the global behavior. Basically, LIME explanations are based on local surrogate models. These, surrogate models are interpretable models (like a linear model or decision tree) that are learned on the predictions of the original black box model. But instead of trying to fit a global surrogate model, LIME focuses on fitting local surrogate models to explain why single predictions were made.The idea is very intuitive. To start with, just try and unlearn what you have done so far! Forget about the training data, forget about how your model works! Think that your model is a black box model with some magic happening inside, where you can input data points and get the models predicted outcomes. You can probe this magic black box as often as you want with inputs and get output predictions.Now, you main objective is to understand why the machine learning model which you are treating as a magic black box, gave the outcome it produced. LIME tries to do this for you! It tests out what happens to you black box model’s predictions when you feed variations or perturbations of your dataset into the black box model. Typically, LIME generates a new dataset consisting of perturbed samples and the associated black box model’s predictions. On this dataset LIME then trains an interpretable model weighted by the proximity of the sampled instances to the instance of interest. Following is a standard high-level workflow for this.We recommend you to read the LIME chapter in Christoph Molnar’s excellent book on Model Interpretation which talks about this in detail.Skater can leverage LIME to explain model predictions. Typically, its LimeTabularExplainer class helps in explaining predictions on tabular (i.e. matrix) data. For numerical features, it perturbs them by sampling from a Normal(0,1) and doing the inverse operation of mean-centering and scaling, according to the means and stds in the training data. For categorical features, it perturbs by sampling according to the training distribution, and making a binary feature that is 1 when the value is the same as the instance being explained. The explain_instance() function generates explanations for a prediction. First, we generate neighborhood data by randomly perturbing features from the instance. We then learn locally weighted linear (surrogate) models on this neighborhood data to explain each of the classes in an interpretable way.Since XGBoost has some issues with feature name ordering when building models with dataframes, we will build our same model with numpy arrays to make LIME work without additional hassles of feature re-ordering. Remember the model being built is the same ensemble model which we treat as our black box machine learning model.Skater gives a nice reasoning below showing which features were the most influential in the model taking the correct decision of predicting the person’s income as below $50K.Skater gives a nice reasoning below showing which features were the most influential in the model taking the correct decision of predicting the person’s income as above $50K.We have see various ways to interpret machine learning models with features, dependence plots and even LIME. But can we build an approximation or a surrogate model which is more interpretable from a really complex black box model like our XGBoost model having hundreds of decision trees?Here in, we introduce the novel idea of using TreeSurrogates as means for explaining a model's learned decision policies (for inductive learning tasks), which is inspired by the work of Mark W. Craven described as the TREPAN algorithm.We recommend checking out the following excellent papers on the TREPAN algorithm to build surrogate trees.Briefly, Trepan constructs a decision tree in a best-first manner. It maintains a queue of leaves which are expanded into subtrees as they are removed from the queue. With each node in the queue, Trepan stores,The stored subset of training examples consists simply of those examples that reach the node. The query instances are used, along with the training examples, to select the splitting test if the node is an internal node or to determine the class label if it is a leaf. The constraint set describes the conditions that instances must satisfy in order to reach the node; this information is used when drawing a set of query instances for a newly created node. The process of expanding a node in Trepan is much like it is in conventional decision tree algorithms: a splitting test is selected for the node, and a child is created for each outcome of the test. Each child is either made a leaf of the tree or put into the queue for future expansion.For Skater’s implementation, for building explainable surrogate models, the base estimator(Oracle) could be any form of a supervised learning predictive model — our black box model. The explanations are approximated using Decision Trees(both for Classification/Regression) by learning decision boundaries similar to that learned by the Oracle (predictions from the base model are used for learning the Decision Tree representation). The implementation also generates a fidelity score to quantify tree based surrogate model’s approximation to the Oracle. Ideally, the score should be 0 for truthful explanation both globally and locally. Let’s check this out in action!NOTE: The implementation is currently experimental and might change in future.We can use the Interpretation object we instantiated earlier to invoke a call to the TreeSurrogate capability.We can now fit this surrogate model on our dataset to learn the decision boundaries of our base estimator.We do this since the feature names in the surrogate tree are not displayed (but are present in the model)We can now visualize our surrogate tree model using the following code.Here are some interesting rules you can observe from the above tree.Feel free to derive more interesting rules from this and also your own models! Let’s look at how our surrogate model performs on the test dataset now.Let’s check the performance of our surrogate model now on the test data.Just as expected, the model performance drops a fair bit but still we get an overall F1-score of 83% as compared to our boosted model’s score of 87% which is quite good!SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a unified approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. SHAP connects game theory with local explanations, uniting several previous methods and representing the only possible consistent and locally accurate additive feature attribution method based on what they claim! (do check out the SHAP NIPS paper for details). We have also covered this in detail in Part 2 of this series.SHAP can be installed from PyPIor conda-forgeThe really awesome aspect about this framework is while SHAP values can explain the output of any machine learning model, for really complex ensemble models it can be slow. But they have developed a high-speed exact algorithm for tree ensemble methods (Tree SHAP arXiv paper). Fast C++ implementations are supported for XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and scikit-learn tree models!SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. Typically, SHAP values try to explain the output of a model (function) as a sum of the effects of each feature being introduced into a conditional expectation. Importantly, for non-linear functions the order in which features are introduced matters. The SHAP values result from averaging over all possible orderings. Proofs from game theory show this is the only possible consistent approach.An intuitive way to understand the Shapley value is the following: The feature values enter a room in random order. All feature values in the room participate in the game (= contribute to the prediction). The Shapley value ϕᵢⱼ is the average marginal contribution of feature value xᵢⱼ by joining whatever features already entered the room before, i.e.The following figure from the KDD 18 paper, Consistent Individualized Feature Attribution for Tree Ensembles summarizes this in a nice way!Let’s now dive into SHAP and leverage it for interpreting our model!Here we use the Tree SHAP implementation integrated into XGBoost to explain the test dataset! Remember that there are a variety of explainer methods based on the type of models you are building. We estimate the SHAP values for a set of samples (test data)This returns a matrix of SHAP values (# samples, # features). Each row sums to the difference between the model output for that sample and the expected value of the model output (which is stored as expected_value attribute of the explainer). Typically this difference helps us in explaining why the model is inclined on predicting a specific class outcome.SHAP gives a nice reasoning below showing which features were the most influential in the model taking the correct decision of predicting the person’s income as below $50K. The below explanation shows features each contributing to push the model output from the base value (the average model output over the training dataset we passed) to the actual model output. Features pushing the prediction higher are shown in red, those pushing the prediction lower are in blue.Similarly, SHAP gives a nice reasoning below showing which features were the most influential in the model taking the correct decision of predicting the person’s income as greater than $50K.One of the key advantages of SHAP is it can build beautiful interactive plots which can visualize and explain multiple predictions at once. Here we visualize model prediction decisions for the first 1000 test data samples.The above visualization can be interacted with in multiple ways. The default visualization shows some interesting model prediction pattern decisions.Definitely interesting how we can find out patterns which lead to the model making specific decisions and being able to provide explanations for them.This basically takes the average of the SHAP value magnitudes across the dataset and plots it as a simple bar chart.Besides a typical feature importance bar chart, SHAP also enables us to use a density scatter plot of SHAP values for each feature to identify how much impact each feature has on the model output for individuals in the validation dataset. Features are sorted by the sum of the SHAP value magnitudes across all samples. Note that when the scatter points don’t fit on a line they pile up to show density, and the color of each point represents the feature value of that individual.It is interesting to note that the age and marital status feature has more total model impact than the capital gain feature, but for those samples where capital gain matters it has more impact than age or marital status. In other words, capital gain affects a few predictions by a large amount, while age or marital status affects all predictions by a smaller amount.SHAP dependence plots show the effect of a single (or two) feature across the whole dataset. They plot a feature’s value vs. the SHAP value of that feature across many samples. SHAP dependence plots are similar to partial dependence plots, but account for the interaction effects present in the features, and are only defined in regions of the input space supported by data. The vertical dispersion of SHAP values at a single feature value is driven by interaction effects, and another feature can be chosen for coloring to highlight possible interactions.You will also notice its similarity with Skater’s Partial Dependence Plots!Let’s take a look at how the Age feature affects model predictions.Just like we observed before. the middle-aged people have a slightly higher shap value, pushing the model’s prediction decisions to say that these individuals make more money as compared to younger or older peopleLet’s take a look at how the Education-Num feature affects model predictions.Higher education levels have higher shap values, pushing the model’s prediction decisions to say that these individuals make more money as compared to people with lower education levels.Let’s take a look at how the Relationship feature affects model predictions.Just like we observed during the model prediction explanations, married people (husband or wife) have a slightly higher shap value, pushing the model’s prediction decisions to say that these individuals make more money as compared to other folks!Let’s take a look at how the Capital Gain feature affects model predictions.The vertical dispersion of SHAP values at a single feature value is driven by interaction effects, and another feature is chosen for coloring to highlight possible interactions. Here we are trying to see interactions between Age and Capital Gainand also their effect on the SHAP values which lead to the model predicting if the person will make more money or not, with the help of a two-way partial dependence plot.Interesting to see higher the higher capital gain and the middle-aged folks (30–50) having the highest chance of making more money!Here we are trying to see interactions between Education-Num and Relationship and also their effect on the SHAP values which lead to the model predicting if the person will make more money or not, with the help of a two-way partial dependence plot.This is interesting because both the features are similar in some context, we can see typically married people with relationship status of either husband or wife having the highest chance of making more money!Here we are trying to see interactions between Marital Status and Relationship and also their effect on the SHAP values which lead to the model predicting if the person will make more money or not, with the help of a two-way partial dependence plot.Interesting to see higher the higher education level and the husband or wife (married) folks having the highest chance of making more money!Here we are trying to see interactions between Age and Hours per week and also their effect on the SHAP values which lead to the model predicting if the person will make more money or not, with the help of a two-way partial dependence plot.Nothing extra-ordinary here, middle-aged people working the most make the most money!If you are reading this, I would like to really commend your efforts on going through this huge and comprehensive tutorial on machine learning model interpretation.

65,The ‘Other Side’ Is Not Dumb,"This story is part of the Internet Time Machine, a collection about life online in the 2010s.There’s a fun game I like to play in a group of trusted friends called “Controversial Opinion.” The rules are simple: Don’t talk about what was shared during Controversial Opinion afterward and you aren’t allowed to “argue” — only to ask questions about why that person feels that way. Opinions can range from, “I think James Bond movies are overrated,” to, “I think Donald Trump would make an excellent president.”Usually, someone responds to an opinion with, “Oh my god! I had no idea you were one of those people!” Which is really another way of saying “I thought you were on my team!”In psychology, the idea that everyone is like us is called the “false-consensus bias.” This bias often manifests itself when we see TV ratings (“Who the hell are all these people that watch NCIS?”) or in politics (“Everyone I know is for stricter gun control! Who are these backward rubes who disagree?!”) or polls (“Who are these people voting for Ben Carson?”).Online it means we can be blindsided by the opinions of our friends or, more broadly, America. Over time, this morphs into a subconscious belief that we and our friends are the sane ones and that there’s a crazy “Other Side” that must be laughed at — an Other Side that just doesn’t “get it,” and is clearly not as intelligent as “us.” But this holier-than-thou social media behavior is counterproductive, it’s self-aggrandizement at the cost of actual nuanced discourse and if we want to consider online discourse productive, we need to move past this.What is emerging is the worst kind of echo chamber, one where those inside are increasingly convinced that everyone shares their worldview, that their ranks are growing when they aren’t. It’s like clockwork: An event happens and then your social media circle is shocked when a non-social media peer group public reacts to news in an unexpected way. They then mock the Other Side for being “out of touch” or “dumb.”Fredrik deBoer, one of my favorite writers around, touched on this in his Essay “Getting Past the Coalition of the Cool.” He writes:[The Internet] encourages people to collapse any distinction between their work life, their social life, and their political life. “Hey, that person who tweets about the TV shows I like also dislikes injustice,” which over time becomes “I can identify an ally by the TV shows they like.” The fact that you can mine a Rihanna video for political content becomes, in that vague internety way, the sense that people who don’t see political content in Rihanna’s music aren’t on your side.When someone communicates that they are not “on our side” our first reaction is to run away or dismiss them as stupid. To be sure, there are hateful, racist, people not worthy of the small amount of electricity it takes just one of your synapses to fire. I’m instead referencing those who actually believe in an opposing viewpoint of a complicated issue, and do so for genuine, considered reasons. Or at least, for reasons just as good as yours.This is not a “political correctness” issue. It’s a fundamental rejection of the possibility to consider that the people who don’t feel the same way you do might be right. It’s a preference to see the Other Side as a cardboard cut out, and not the complicated individual human beings that they actually are.What happens instead of genuine intellectual curiosity is the sharing of Slate or Daily Kos or Fox News or Red State links. Sites that exist almost solely to produce content to be shared so friends can pat each other on the back and mock the Other Side. Look at the Other Side! So dumb and unable to see this the way I do!It’s a preference to see the Other Side as a cardboard cut out, and not the complicated individual human beings that they actually are.Sharing links that mock a caricature of the Other Side isn’t signaling that we’re somehow more informed. It signals that we’d rather be smug assholes than consider alternative views. It signals that we’d much rather show our friends that we’re like them than try to understand those who are not.It’s impossible to consider yourself a curious person and participate in social media in this way. We cannot consider ourselves “empathetic” only to turn around and belittle those who don’t agree with us.On Twitter and Facebook, this means we prioritize by sharing stuff that will garner the approval of our peers over stuff that’s actually, you know, true. We share stuff that ignores wider realities, selectively shares information, or is just an outright falsehood. The misinformation is so rampant that the Washington Post stopped publishing its internet fact-checking column because people didn’t seem to care if stuff was true.Where debunking an Internet fake once involved some research, it’s now often as simple as clicking around for an “about” or “disclaimer” page. And where a willingness to believe hoaxes once seemed to come from a place of honest ignorance or misunderstanding, that’s frequently no longer the case. Headlines like “Casey Anthony found dismembered in truck” go viral via old-fashioned schadenfreude — even hate.…Institutional distrust is so high right now, and cognitive bias so strong always, that the people who fall for hoax news stories are frequently only interested in consuming information that conforms with their views — even when it’s demonstrably fake.The solution is, as deBoer says, “You have to be willing to sacrifice your carefully curated social performance and be willing to work with people who are not like you.” In other words, you have to recognize that the Other Side is made of actual people.But I’d like to go a step further. We should all enter every issue with the very real possibility that we might be wrong this time.Isn’t it possible that you, reader of Medium and Twitter power user, like me, suffer from this from time to time? Isn’t it possible that we’re not right about everything? That those who live in places not where you live, watch shows that you don’t watch and read books that you don’t read, have opinions and belief systems just as valid as yours? That maybe you don’t see the entire picture?Think political correctness has gotten out of control? Follow the many great social activists on Twitter. Think America’s stance on guns is puzzling? Read the stories of the 31% of Americans that own a firearm. This is not to say the Other Side is “right” but that they likely have real reasons to feel that way. And only after understanding those reasons can a real discussion take place.Isn’t it possible that you, reader of Medium and Twitter power user, like me, suffer from this from time to time? Isn’t it possible that we’re not right about everything?As any debate club veteran knows, if you can’t make your opponent’s point for them, you don’t truly grasp the issue. We can bemoan political gridlock and a divisive media all we want. But we won’t truly progress as individuals until we make an honest effort to understand those that are not like us. And you won’t convince anyone to feel the way you do if you don’t respect their position and opinions.A dare for the next time you’re in discussion with someone you disagree with: Don’t try to “win.” Don’t try to “convince” anyone of your viewpoint. Don’t score points by mocking them to your peers. Instead, try to “lose.” Hear them out. Ask them to convince you and mean it. No one is going to tell your environmentalist friends that you merely asked follow-up questions after your brother made his pro-fracking case.Or, the next time you feel compelled to share a link on social media about current events, ask yourself why you are doing it. Is it because that link brings to light information you hadn’t considered? Or does it confirm your world view, reminding your circle of intellectual teammates that you’re not on the Other Side?I implore you to seek out your opposite. When you hear someone cite “facts” that don’t support your viewpoint don’t think “that can’t be true!” Instead consider, “Hm, maybe that person is right? I should look into this.”Because refusing to truly understand those who disagree with you is intellectual laziness and worse, is usually worse than what you’re accusing the Other Side of doing.Keep exploring the Internet Time Machine.Written by"
66,The Legend Of The Biggie Belt,"I feel silly telling this story. I mean, it’s just a belt. But it matters to me.The story begins in 1997 at The Source magazine.And it starts with Rigo “Riggs” Morales.Last week, Riggs was named senior VP, A&R and artist development at Atlantic Records. Over the past 20 years, Riggs has signed and guided dozens of platinum-selling acts, from Eminem to Wiz Khalifa and Janelle Monae.He is an accomplished executive, respected by his peers and musicians. But 23 years ago, he was a writer and editor at The Source magazine. And he was over it.After a few years at the red-hot center of hip-hop journalism, he felt like he wasn’t getting the right support. Or the right promotions. Months later with a new title — associate music editor — he made it clear that he wanted to be the music editor, which was the number two job at the magazine. Instead, he was given yet another new title: senior associate music editor. “You know what that stands for right,” he said to a coworker. “It spells out S.A.M.E. New title. Same responsibilities.”Riggs was ready to go. He was close to everyone in the office and had started his career as an intern at the magazine. But he still knew he had gone as far as he was willing to go. The announcement was made that he was leaving, and some of his fellow writers were stunned. Riggs was an institution. He shrugged when people asked questions. “It’s just time,” he would say.Riggs had an actual office, a rarity for most of The Source employees. When you walked in, there was a left turn to the subdued advertising and marketing side of the office, where the publisher, Dave Mays, held court in a quiet back lair. Make a right turn instead, and there was a cacophonous bullpen. There were a few dozen writers, editors, and assistants all blaring music, from Wu-Tang to Buju Banton, some from cushy window offices facing Park Avenue South, some facing the back of a co-worker’s head in a cubicle dump. There was no peace and no privacy. And you would think headphones had not yet been invented.The cubicles were affectionately known as The Projects, a nod to their cramped space. The offices lining the walls that led to the editor-in-chief’s office were known as The Condos. The fire escape, known as The Porch, was used for midday vices, including shots of Hennessy and smoking blunts. The other tenants in 215 Park Avenue South did not appreciate it and complained often.The Source, born nine years earlier in a Harvard University dorm room, had moved from Cambridge to New York City, first to a scrappy space with hardwood floors on Broadway, then to the Projects and Condos corporate building off Union Square Park. By 1999, Jann Wenner, owner of Rolling Stone, had offered to buy the title after seeing its astronomical double-digit growth on newsstands and subscriptions in less than a decade. The publisher, Mays, declined.Riggs’ condo was piled high with hip-hop memorabilia, submissions for the magazine’s Unsigned Hype column, dolls, cassettes, magazines, and posters. Over the course of a week, he slowly and methodically packed up his office, parceling out some goodies to random co-workers and boxing up the rest.When he was done, there was only one item left in the office. Something he could neither give away nor take himself.Riggs asked around to find out who would be moving into his office after he left. He called and said to come by his office when they had a chance. He had an extremely important message for the new associate music editor. He waited.That new editor? That was me.Ending up at The Source magazine was nothing short of a miracle. I have the background — born and raised in East Orange, New Jersey, adjacent to Newark, home to groups like Naughty by Nature and Redman. I’m hip-hop by osmosis. I was too young to ever have made it to clubs like The Zanzibar and Club 88 at their height. But I was steeped in hip-hop, all the way back to finding the smooth grooves on the blacktop of my street so my six-year-old self could roller skate to “Rapper’s Delight.” It would feel like a rink — not just a random pothole-filled street on the good side of the ’hood.The year 1988, a banner year for hip-hop, did not move me. I bopped to Big Daddy Kane’s Long Live the Kane debut but crushed on him more than his music. As a child of the NOI, I respected Public Enemy but didn’t buy It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back with my meager allowance. I mean, come on, Bobby Brown’s Don’t Be Cruel had just dropped too!Truth be told, my life changed forever when Mariah Carey released Vision of Love during my senior year.I opted not to mention that during my interview at The Source in the summer of 1999. I know now that my boss, Selwyn Seyfu Hinds, was not looking for me to be a hip-hop head. He had plenty of those. After a decade of having writers who were fiercely loyal to the culture, he wanted to expand. The music department — all male for years — needed some feminine energy. And it wouldn’t be the end of the world if her first love was R&B.Some of my future co-workers weren’t so sure about that.I came in as a staff writer, and I kept my head down and wrote my ass off. Riggs was one of the first to officially acknowledge me. I was headed to the bathroom. He sped past me on a scooter and yelled out something that sounded like, “That story was dope, yo.” He was gone, back in his office, before I could respond. But he’d cleared the air. If Riggs was acknowledging my existence, it was okay for the other writers and editors to do the same. I started to get a “hey, what’s up” from a few folks. Occasionally.A few months later, I went undercover as a high school student for a story on a young rapper named Lady Luck who was signed to Def Jam while still in high school. Her label would not let me go to school with her, so it was decided that I would dress down and sneak into school to get color for my story.At this point, Big was the biggest rapper on the planet. The idea that he would be walking around with a fake leather belt that was falling apart was perplexing and hilarious.I bought a pair of overalls, a red Jansport backpack, and a crisp pair of white Air Force 1s, the first I’d ever owned. I changed in the bathroom and made a point to walk by Riggs to see if he would notice. He didn’t say a word and kept walking. Finally, I called out to him, and he did a double take. He circled me, nodding approvingly. He gave me a single warning: not to get a speck of dirt on my sneakers before the first day. No self-respecting high school kid would show up on the first day of school with dirt on their sneakers.I listened to Riggs’ advice, not for the last time, and all was well.The next time — and last time — I listened to Riggs, he was calling me into his office, the one I was moving into, on his last day.Riggs was a jovial guy. He was hip-hop down to a cellular level — but he didn’t take himself or the culture too seriously. He smiled. Which was rare in late ’90s hip-hop. The scowl was the rule, not the exception. I had learned to keep my normally chipper personality a bit muted.When I stepped into his office, I was immediately thrown off. He wasn’t smiling. He was packing up last-minute things and not making eye contact.“Hey, close the door. And have a seat.”All I could think was: Did they tell him to fire me when I thought I had his job?“Look at the door,” he said.On the back of the door was a peeling pleather belt. The belt was so long that although the buckle was nearly at the top of the door, the end of the belt was almost to the floor. I looked back at Riggs for an explanation.“It’s Biggie’s belt.”I looked closer and shook my head in disbelief.“No way.”“Yeah, it is. Look at the notch. That’s where he had to close it.”I took the belt off the hook. It wrapped around my waist several times, and I saw the well-worn notch that had been punched in with a sharp edge. Whoever that belt belonged to was huge.“This is really B.I.G.’s belt?” I asked Riggs. “How did it get here?”And then Riggs told me “The Legend of the Biggie Belt.”In 1997, Big came up to the office. He was being fitted for a photo shoot and had to take off his belt. It was raggedy, and Riggs and a few other folks were clowning him about it. At this point, Big was the biggest rapper on the planet. The idea that he would be walking around with a fake leather belt that was falling apart was perplexing and hilarious. Big’s alias was Frank White, from King of New York! Christopher Walken’s character would never wear a belt like that. Riggs told him to toss it. Big said no. He told Riggs to hold on to it and that he’d come back to the office and pick it up.Instead, a few weeks later, on March 9, 1997, Big was shot in a drive-by shooting in Los Angeles. While sitting at a red light, the shooter fired from an Impala into the passenger door of Big’s GMC Suburban. Big was hit with four bullets. He was pronounced dead shortly after.Riggs left the belt on his office door. It didn’t feel like a monumental relic or symbol of hip-hop history. It wasn’t one of Big’s infamous Coogi sweaters or the Versace sunglasses that he wore or shouted out in his rhymes. It was a no-name brand size 52 belt. And yet, Riggs decided it needed to stay in that spot.“That belt doesn’t leave this office,” Riggs said to me.I nodded.“Not under any circumstances,” he continued. “It stays right there. Right on that hook. Unless Big himself comes here to get it, it doesn’t move.”“I got it.”“If you move offices or if you leave The Source, the belt stays here. You can tell the next person who moves in here.”Riggs left. I moved in the next day. And for my time in that office, I can’t say I thought about the belt much. I could only see it when my door was closed, which was rare. And there was so much going on at a place like The Source, there was little time for reverie.But I touched it absentmindedly from time to time. And I did break the rule just once and told the whole story to my friend Paul from high school. His wide-eyed and slack-jawed silence reminded me how special it was to have such a tiny piece of history in my office.I never moved the belt. I rarely thought about the belt. And then, one day, something weird happened.I woke up one morning, the sun heavy on my face. It was that in-between moment when your eyes are still closed but your brain is waking up. I yawned, opened my eyes, and expected to see my roommate’s cat at the foot of my bed. But I wasn’t in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. I wasn’t in the three-bedroom apartment I shared with Dylan and Amanda.I was in a hotel room in San Francisco, California, after spending a week following The Lox on a college tour. I was so exhausted from constant traveling and writing that my brain had me back home a full day before I would be there.It was time to leave The Source. The job was a dream come true, but I was ready to find a tiny corner of the world and sit with my laptop and churn out some books.When you go undercover as a high school student, attend The Source Awards (which ends with you dragging your eight months’ pregnant co-worker to a bathroom to hide from Suge Knight’s crew), then go undercover as a stripper at Magic City in Atlanta — and then spend time with DMX in New York, then Cash Money in New Orleans, then Ruff Ryders in Yonkers, and then chase down Mase in Times Square when he retires from rapping — and when all those things happen in the same three-month period…Yeah. It was time to pack up the office. And make a phone call.After I gave notice, my boss asked me to make a recommendation for my replacement. It wouldn’t be my decision, but my thoughts would make a difference.I called Jermaine Hall. Jermaine has been my friend for 20 years, yet I’m not quite sure how we met. I know I briefly dated a friend of his in the late ’90s. We may have met that way. But I remember that when I was leaving The Source, he was one of my go-to writers. I invited him for a pre-interview and then told my boss he’d be perfect.On my last day in the office, I was packing up, and I’d asked Jermaine to come by before I left for good. My condo, like Riggs’ before me, was a hot mess. Books, magazines, clothes, empty Henny bottles. The Source was nothing if not a good time.Jermaine looked around with wide eyes and found a place to perch.“Look,” I said. “Behind you.”Jermaine turned and his eyes followed the belt from the top of the door to the floor.“Is that a belt?” he asked.I nodded.“It’s Biggie’s belt,” I said.“Yeah, right,” said Jermaine. “How would Big’s belt be in here?”“In 1997, Big came to the office,” I began.I finished the story Riggs told me the year before. And like me, Jermaine was stunned. Jermaine has been a Bad Boy stan since Craig Mack’s “Flava in Ya Ear.” He would go on to interview every artist on the label, including three stories on Puff, one being the legendary Playboy Q. And yet, with all of his interactions with the label, he’d never seen Big perform, never interviewed him. Like me, he came into journalism right on the cusp of the deaths of Pac and Big. Everything dealing with those two was a hushed whisper by the time we came into the field. Some of our fellow writers had video of Big, some had cassette tapes of interviews, some had hung out with him, some had helped put him on. But the writers who came after 1997?We had a belt. A size 52 pleather belt.After I told Jermaine about the belt, I gathered the last of my things and bounced. It was August 2001.I’ve been a freelance writer, author, and journalist ever since. And after I left The Source, I never thought about the belt at all. A few years after I left, I got my first book deal, collaborating with singer Faith Evans on her memoir, Keep the Faith. Even during a year and a half of interviewing Faith about her relationship with Big, including their tempestuous, drama-filled marriage, I never told her about Big’s belt. It never came to mind.“That belt doesn’t leave this office. … Unless Big himself comes here to get it, it doesn’t move.”And then, in 2009, I saw the trailer for the movie Notorious. I didn’t plan to see the film — after writing the book with Faith, I was a bit too close to the story.But the belt popped into my head for the first time in nearly a decade.I called Jermaine. At this point, Jermaine was long gone from The Source and had moved on to Vibe, where I wrote for him often.“Where’s the belt?” I asked Jermaine.“What belt?”I held in an internal scream.“Big’s belt! I told you what to do with it!”Jermaine was silent and then remembered.“I did what you told me, Aliya! I told Gotti, don’t touch it, don’t tell anyone. Pass it on. I swear.”I breathed a sigh of relief. And here is where it gets weird. Or rather, here is where I get weird. After Jermaine told me he passed the story of the belt, I wanted to know where it ended up. At that point, it had been 12 years since Big gave it to Riggs. And 10 years since Riggs entrusted it to me.I wanted to know what happened to that size 52 peeling piece of pleather. I felt like I had a responsibility to Big, to Riggs, to The Source to keep it safe.But I couldn’t find Jonathan “Gotti” Bonanno. Jermaine told me to look for Thomas Golianopoulos, who’d worked there at the same time. It just so happened that I ran into Thomas at an industry event a few days later. I turned on my camera phone and asked him point-blank: What happened to the belt?Thomas told me that when he started at The Source, Gotti told him about the belt. He looked up at it, took in the story, and vowed to keep his mouth shut and keep it safe.Thomas was only in the office for three months. He told me a woman named Kimberly Burgess moved in. I found her on Facebook and looked her up.“Yes,” she said, “Thomas told me about the belt. I didn’t touch it. I didn’t tell anyone. I followed the rules. I wasn’t there very long. But when I left, I told the next person. His name is Joel Randell. You’ll need to find him to see what happened.”Riggs. Me. Jermaine. Gotti. Thomas. Kimberly. Joel.At this point, I got chills every time someone told me “I did what Riggs said to do.”Why do I care? Here’s the best way I can describe it. In January of 1977, I was three years old. I was a precocious kid, and I loved to be in grown folks’ business. But for a week straight, there was something going on at my house that I couldn’t quite understand. First, my dad came home early each day. And there were people crowded around the television: friends and family and some people I didn’t know. There was electricity in the room — with a slight tinge of fear. I didn’t want to watch what was on television every night that week. There were weapons and whips and crying and strange noises.It was the miniseries Roots, the film version of Alex Haley’s magnum opus. It would take me many years to understand why my people were so invested in the miniseries. This was not just a film. This was unanswered questions about life — all of our lives. What a privilege to know where you came from. To know your people going back generations. When I finally read Roots, I cried at the part where he names his ancestors from Kunta Kinte down to himself.I can’t go any further than great-grandparents on both sides. And I’m not even sure what’s accurate. And as for physical things, I have even less. I have my grandmother’s wedding band, which I wore as my own. And that’s it.Most Black folks don’t have stories. We don’t have heavy Bibles handed down through generations with words like begat and betrothed. We have oral histories, often flawed.My dad died three years ago. I handled it like the true stoic I am. No tears. But a few months later, I found his wallet and went through it. And my college ID was in there. And I wept. For 30 years, he’d kept his own relic close by. Even though I saw him all the time, he wanted this small piece of plastic nearby every day. It was as new as the day I thought I lost it.Things matter. We give things value.Joel Randell was hard to find. I stalked him on social media, posting to his wall, sending him DMs on every platform. A friend of mine told me to let it go. The story of the Biggie belt was cute. It had lasted from Riggs in 1997 for a decade. It’s okay to let it go.I didn’t let it go.I asked a mutual friend to reach out to Joel. He finally called me, apologizing for ignoring what seemed like spam. He told me that on his very first day at The Source, he settled into his office and closed the door. He was filling out paperwork from HR when there was a knock. Gotti walks in, no eye contact, splitting a blunt with his nails. He closes the door.“What’s your name?” he says.“I’m Joel.”“I need to tell you about this belt,” says Gotti, as he rolls his blunt.And at that moment, in March of 2004, Joel became the seventh Keeper of the Belt. He was gone a few months later. The Source was going through a round of internal and external issues, from budgets to staffing woes. Joel bailed for a position at Star and never thought about the belt until I called him five years later.Here, it gets murky. A dude named J. Pablo was at the office at some point. I think I spoke to him about his involvement as a Keeper of the Belt, but I’m not even sure. Here’s what I know. The Source left 215 Park Avenue South in 2005. Most of the people I’d worked with were long gone. I had stopped writing for the magazine and didn’t even look for it on newsstands. Because of all the drama surrounding it, I didn’t even list it on my resume anymore.But I remained a proud writer from The Source, surrounded by people I admire and still do. My first editor-in-chief Selwyn and his replacement, Carlito Rodriguez, both write for film and television. If you look at a single masthead from my era, the list of accomplished writers is telling, from writer Ta-Nehisi Coates to filmmaker Erik Parker. It’s a special place.Robert “Boo” Rosario was an assistant in the music department when I got there. Boo was unapologetically hood, rough around the edges, and very loyal. If I ever went to an event, party, concert, or listening session, I looked around for him. If he was there, I could truly relax. Nothing was happening to anyone at The Source if Boo was in the house. And it would be a guaranteed good time.Well, after I left and over the years, Boo got a few promotions. When The Source moved, it was his job to pack up any vacant offices. He headed straight for the office with the belt.There was someone in there. A staffer who had learned the story. He was slowly rolling up the belt and trying to dip out. Boo stopped him.“What the fuck are you doing?” Boo asked.“Oh, come on, Boo,” the staffer said. “It’s just a fucking belt. Maybe we’ll get a few bucks on eBay. I’ll split it with you.”Boo snatched the belt and packed it away with his things. And he carried that box to the new office in his own hand. Boo became the eighth (or maybe ninth) Keeper of the Belt.The Source continued to become unstable. Every day Boo went to work, he felt it could be his last. One day, after a screaming argument with one of the owners of the magazine, Boo left for the day but then came right back, got the belt, and then went home. Just a hunch.The next day, all the codes were changed, and security would not let him in. He was never able to get anything from his office.But he had the belt.Boo made his way back to Philadelphia, stored the belt in a firesafe box, and told no one about it. A few years later, he heard that I was looking for him. At first, he wouldn’t tell me that he had it. He just said he knew where it was and that it was safe. Then I heard him opening something in the background, and he told me yes, he had his hands on the belt.“I’m holding it right now,” Boo said to me back in 2009. “It’s a size 52. Damn. I never look at the belt. But I just went into the firesafe box to check on it while I’m on the phone with you. And I just got a chill. I’ve always taken care of the belt. But I’m just realizing. Damn, this is really Big’s belt!”That was in 2009. I may or may not have shed a tear. From 1997 to 2009, the belt was kept safe by eight (or nine) Keepers of the Belt who had no real reason to do so. Except that sometimes value just is.It’s now been 20 years since Riggs told me “The Legend of the Biggie Belt.” I called Boo a few days ago. I was thinking maybe he could come up to New York and we could do a shoot with the belt. I haven’t seen it since I left The Source. Jermaine is my boss these days as editor-in-chief here at Level. Joel lives in Barbados. Kimberly and Thomas said they’d try to come by.But the belt? Well, Boo moved around a lot over the past decade. It’s still in the firesafe box. But he left it with his mom when his living situation was very unstable. And moms move things. We know the belt is there, but Boo wasn’t able to find it right away. By the time you read this, he’s probably found it.It’s the anniversary of Big’s death. I wanted a big, splashy photo of the belt to accompany this story. I don’t have that. I just have the goosebumps that I get every time I think of eight (or nine) people, over the course of a decade, holding on to a peeling pleather size 52 belt. Like it’s a grandmother’s wedding band. Or a child’s college ID card. Or just a tiny bit of hip-hop history.Written by"
67,How It Feels to Live With AIDS for 30 Years,"For more information on the novel coronavirus and Covid-19, visit cdc.gov.The first time I met Chris, he told me he had AIDS. And I laughed out loud.Let me explain.We were at a brunch last year hosted by a notable Twitter/media personality. Every so often, she gathers a group of folks from various industries for food and drinks and some low-pressure networking. Not my thing, usually, but I was there as my boyfriend’s plus-one — well, one of his plus-two. He also invited his brother Chris so we could meet. Except Chris was late.Eventually, I saw him step in, dapper and assured. He surveyed the room and then sat across from me at the table — but not without giving me the up-and-down outfit check. (I passed, I guess.) We discussed the menu, agreed on the oxtail hash, and then continued reading the room and making small talk. It was a fish-out-of-water sort of solidarity: The room skewed millennial, and everyone looked like social media stars with massively successful podcasts we’d never heard of, so we used each other as lifelines.Somewhere between mimosas two and three, the notable Twitter/media personality urged a round of introductions — dressed up in the question “What’s been your biggest flex of 2019?” As the tidal wave of personal accomplishments rolled around the room, Chris and I made eye contact with a silent, shared question: What are you going to say? Not that we haven’t been successful in our lives, but these folks were saying things like, “I just got my second patent!” (Cue golf claps and woo-hoos.) “My Grammy shelf got a little more crowded!” (Cue more golf claps and woo-hoos.)Chris leaned over to me.“You know what I got?” he stage-whispered.I shake my head.“I got AIDS.”His timing and delivery, that full-on eye-rolling sarcasm dripped in crushing reality, made me choke-laugh on my drink.“I’m serious,” said Chris, a smirk playing on his face. “That’s my flex. I made it to my 30th year with AIDS. And I’m alive. And thriving.”At that moment, I knew I loved Chris.I also knew I wanted to know more. How do you survive AIDS for 30 years?In April of 1980, Ken Horne was diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma. A year later, he would be retroactively identified as the first person in the United States officially diagnosed with what would be called AIDS.At the time that Horne was diagnosed in San Francisco, Christopher Michael Patrick Cunningham was 13 years old, living in the Bronx with his mother Cynthia, his stepfather Jimmy, and his three-year-old brother Shane. He was a straight-A student, a good kid in general. “And,” he says now, “definitely, for-sure, 100% gay.”“A generally healthy male would have a T cell count of 600–1500. By the time Chris returned to New York City, he had exactly 57.”When Chris makes a definitive statement, he gets a twinkle in his eye, sucks in his cheeks, raises an eyebrow, and gives a quick head nod. And that’s that.Chris had known he was gay since he was six: crushes on boys, the whole thing. He didn’t think anything of it — until he was 14. His mother found his journal where he waxed poetic about a crush. She called him a “deviant.”Yet, the homophobia stopped there. Out in the world, in the South Bronx of the early ’80s, Chris maintains that no one ever bullied him. “My whole crew would fuck up anybody who said anything to me.”That crew called themselves the Cosby Kids, back when that still used to mean wholesome. While some of Chris’ friends had parents with money, he worked to get his hands on Benetton cardigans, Polo socks, and down coats from the Spiegel catalog. He was chocolate brown with a perfect blinding-white smile and sleepy, heavy-lidded eyes. He had a fake girlfriend to keep up appearances in his teen circles, even though everyone knew better. Life was about school, getting money, and having fly clothes and a good time.Then his boy Derick was killed.We all have those moments where everything shifts. Those events that we look back on and we know that nothing was ever the same. It could be the birth of a sibling, a parent’s illness, a divorce, or a cross-country move where you leave friends behind.For Chris, it was the night Derrick asked him to come out to Co-op City, a massive high-rise development in another part of the Bronx. The two were best friends; Derrick may have been straight, but he made it clear to Chris that he didn’t care about his orientation. They hung out, acted a fool in school, and leaned on each other in that silent way young men often do.Election night 1984: Derrick called Chris to tag along on a trip to go see his girl. It was a school night, so Chris’ mom said no.Thing is, Derrick’s girlfriend had another boyfriend, an unhinged drug dealer. The unhinged drug dealer had heard she was being unfaithful and made her lure Derrick to her building — then beat Derrick nearly to death with a baseball bat.Derrick survived. But over the next two years, he slowly degenerated in a rehab facility.“Nothing mattered,” says Chris, his voice cracking 35 years later. “I had more conflict with my mom. I went from a straight-A student to just scraping by. My mom told me I should talk to an Army recruiter at my school. Maybe routine and structure would help me get on target.”She invited an Army rep to their home to talk about his options. She told Chris that in order to even speak to the recruiter, he’d have to sign some forms. Chris signed off, open to at least hearing the man out.Except he’d actually signed himself in. His own mother had tricked him. When the sergeant came over, it was to give Chris his marching orders to report to basic training.Which he would — but not before Derrick died of his injuries.June 29, 1986, Chris was in basic training. Army superiors were screaming in his face, calling him “faggot,” calling him “nigger.”Chris rolled his eyes. Motherfucker, I’m from Soundview. Try harder. This air smells fresh and clean, and I’m far from home. Keep yelling. I’m good.It wasn’t until he got to basic training that Chris realized the strength of his armor. All around him, people were being sent home because they couldn’t stop crying because they missed their parents — people who had already been given that age-old choice of jail or the military.“Straight-up hardened criminals couldn’t get through basic training,” he said. “I sailed through that shit.”There’s that twinkle in the eye, cheeks sucked in, one eyebrow raised, and a quick head nod. And that’s that.In 1986, while Chris was sailing through basic training, the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses ruled that the virus that causes AIDS would henceforth officially be called HIV (human immunodeficiency virus).And, in 1986, while Chris was sailing through basic training, AIDS was a death sentence — and whatever time you had left to live, you’d spend it as a pariah. Ryan White, a White teenager in Indiana who had contracted the disease from a blood transfusion, became the poster child for the disease, a symbol of the hysteria and paranoia surrounding the virus. When his mother Jeanne went shopping, skittish cashiers would throw the change onto the counter, so as not to touch her. The superintendent of his school district barred Ryan from attending. (Despite being told he had six months to live, Ryan White held on for years, finally succumbing to complications in 1990.)By the time Chris finished up basic training and headed to Germany, 85 countries had reported nearly 40,000 cases of AIDS — more than 31,000 of which were in the Americas. Half of all those previously diagnosed were dead. Most died within 15 months of being diagnosed.The official prediction was that there would be twice as many cases in the following year.As a young gay Black man, Chris would be considered high-risk, but he was as far away from contracting the virus as one could possibly be. He wasn’t even thinking about sex.“This is long before Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” said Chris. “If they found out you were gay, it was over. I’m loving the routine and structure. I’m loving being good at what I do. I’m loving traveling to places like Stuttgart and Amsterdam. Why risk that? I said and did nothing to compromise a life that made sense for me.”His next step after Germany was Denver. It would almost be his last.In 1987, just before Chris relocated, the CDC began school-based HIV education for young people to prevent the disease from spreading. By 1988, funding had been established for national, regional, and community-based organizations — including CAP, the Colorado AIDS Project.Chris knew nothing about CAP. Why would he? The virus was national news, but he didn’t think it applied to him.Besides, things were good. “I’m barely legal,” he said, remembering. “Money in my pocket and good friends by my side. If I were at home in New York City, I would have understood what was going on. But I’m in Denver, Colorado. I’m thinking about these fine-ass Black guys at Club Raven every weekend. I’m invincible. And beyond that, I’m still not having sex. At 21 years old.”In Denver, there was one place for service members to hang out on the weekends. It wasn’t a gay bar; if Denver even had those, Chris knew nothing about them. It was all about Club Raven. That’s where he and his friends were adopted by a crew of older Black guys — “thirty plus, with cars and good jobs,” he says.That’s where Chris met John, a track star at the University of Colorado in Boulder, 30 minutes north of Denver. There was a brief courtship, they hooked up — and soon after, John vanished. No one called it “ghosting” yet; it was just on until it wasn’t. Chris called John, screaming, raw. It was the first time he realized that intimacy was vulnerable, and that vulnerability can hurt.So intimacy gave way to something that hurt a lot less: semi-anonymous sex under the gauzy lights of Club Raven, in the haze of drinks and smoke. Not every day, maybe. But at least every weekend.A few miles away from Club Raven, some of the first clinics for AIDS patients were using a new test to determine a patient’s health. CD4+ helper T cells, often referred to as just T cells, help the immune system detect and respond to threats, and they’re crucial for measuring how HIV and AIDS are progressing.A generally healthy male would have a T cell count of 600–1500 cells per cubic millimeter of blood. That’s likely what Chris had when he arrived in Denver. Anything under 200 is considered full-blown AIDS.By the time Chris returned to New York City, he had exactly 57.Things moved fast from there. Chris was working at Paragon, the massive sporting goods store near Manhattan’s Union Square. One of his co-workers was this cool ass White kid, a weedhead from New England named Jay. Chris ended up losing his apartment and moving in with Jay and his friends. Not soon after, he started feeling sick.Jay noticed and told Chris to see a doctor. “I’m a vet so I can go to the VA hospital,” he says now, “but I still didn’t go right away.”The fatigue became so intense that he couldn’t work. The sicker Chris got, the more Jay and his friends held him down, letting him stay even after he couldn’t keep up with the rent and bills.“And then one day,” says Chris. “I looked in the mirror and saw how swollen my glands were.”It was called the Monster back then, a nickname earned by how quickly it took down those infected. Jay and his friends took Chris to Long Island University Hospital, and the Monster came with them.“I could barely lift my head up by that point,” says Chris. “I couldn’t even hold my water inside the MRI machine. I remember one doctor looking me in the eye and giving me the diagnosis — and then telling me I was the sickest person in the entire hospital. Even through the pain, I’m like, did we need that extra bit of information?”All these years later, he’s still annoyed at that part. There’s another twinkle in the eye, one eyebrow raised, and a quick side-eye.That’s where the story should have ended.“At 23, Christopher Cunningham was brilliant, hilarious, sexy, and generous.” That’s how the funeral program would have described him, one tattered copy tucked away in a family photo album. He would have been buried at St. Raymond’s or The Woodlawn as a veteran, with a simple headstone. His 13-year-old brother Shane would have been devastated. And 30 years later, Chris would be just a distant memory, the subject of stories Shane shares with me, his girlfriend, on those nights when a new couple talks about the things that make us cry.Instead, 30 years later, New Year’s Day 2020, I’m in bed with Chris.Let me explain.I had a New Year’s party. The next morning, half of my guests were still spilled around my apartment, recovering.From downstairs, I hear a shout. “Aliya!”It’s Chris. I sit up straight. The night before, he’d been the first to conk out, while the after-after-after party was still in swing. He’d hit a military style flat back on my living room sofa and was out like a light.“Come up here!” I yell back.And before I knew it, before I could register the absurdity of it all, I brought in the new year with the people I love piled onto my bed.“What are we going to talk about,” Chris asks me. “When you interview me?”After that first flexes-and-mimosas brunch, I had asked Chris if I could interview him about how he survived 30 years with AIDS. (Not just HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. By the time he was diagnosed, it was full blown.)Even after Chris explained why and how he’s still alive, it just didn’t make sense. Even if you grew up, as I did, knowing that Magic Johnson had managed to survive HIV without it turning into AIDS. Because folks with AIDS — folks like Ryan White and Arthur Ashe — those folks always died.So from a purely medical standpoint, Chris’ trajectory made no sense.Before he could even get his medications and begin setting up a new routine, Chris called back to Colorado to check on his friends. Clifford told him James was dead; Kenneth told him Clifford was dead. A week later, Kenneth was dead too. Every week, more people were just … gone.Within a few months, all the men Chris hung out with at Club Raven were dead. Even with the intensity of the disease, the mortality rate in that ecosystem was particularly high.Chris learned many years later about HIV superinfections, reinfections that occur when HIV-positive people continue high-risk behavior with others who are also HIV-positive and becoming reinfected, making themselves sicker in the process. The process can continue indefinitely.Did the older guys know what was happening in the community? And, if so, was Chris resentful that they weren’t more careful and didn’t do more to warn him about what was happening?“Looking back, Clifford would say things like, ‘You’re going out with that guy? Looks like he’s losing weight…’ But I didn’t know that was a clue. We didn’t talk about it forthright. And even if we did, I probably wouldn’t have been more careful. I believed I was invincible.”Chris estimates that he was re-infected several times in Colorado, which is how he could return to New York just a year or so later and have a T cell count as low as his was.So here’s where Chris starts taking his medications consistently and does so for the next 30 years, right?Not so much. Mostly because the side effects were brutal. “I didn’t take my meds,” said Chris. “A lot of us didn’t. I felt like it was killing me. Meds like AZT were working, but sometimes they were as bad as not taking anything at all.” In 1996 alone, he lost 30 pounds.The same year that Chris was at his sickest since contracting the disease, he was told to begin taking a cocktail of drugs that were said to have a Lazarus effect on patients. (Lazarus is a biblical figure who was brought back from the dead). He agreed. And decided to comply. His doctor told him, have a good attitude, wear bright colors, and take the fucking meds.Since 1997, Chris’ viral load has been completely undetectable.Today, 1.1 million people live with an HIV infection. Gay and bisexual men, including African American men, remain disproportionately affected.Over 700,000 people have died since Ken Horne’s diagnosis in 1981.Today, Chris works with Volunteers of America, providing services to vulnerable populations, including homeless people, homeless veterans, people who have aged out of foster care, and people with substance abuse and mental health disorders.“I’m here because I’m supposed to be. I was on my deathbed at 24; now I’m 52. I wear bright colors, think positive, and take my fucking meds.”There’s that twinkle in the eye, the eyebrow raise, the quick head nod.That’s that.Written by"
68,In Praise of Winter Running,"For more information on the novel coronavirus and Covid-19, visit cdc.gov.Last winter, I headed north from my apartment in Brooklyn to a writing residency in rural Maine. The running shoes I threw in with my sweaters and long underwear seemed mostly aspirational; the average high for the month in the town where I would be staying was 26 degrees.But humans are not bears, and our bodies crave movement year-round — at least mine does — even when the temperature is below freezing. After two days of staring at my laptop and moving no farther than from my desk chair to my armchair and back again, I put on my sneakers.The house I was staying in overlooked a lake topped with four feet of ice. “Lake” is a bit of a misnomer in winter—something I didn’t understand until I was standing at its edge, blinking in the five-degree sunlight. Covered in snow and surrounded by trees, it looked more like a field than a body of water. It was there that I went for my first run.My first surprise was the heat. Running, like all exercise, warms the body. The best advice I’ve ever received for running in cold weather is to dress like the temperature is 20 degrees higher than it is. Even following this guideline, though, I quickly overheated. I unzipped my hoodie. Then my gloves went into my pockets. Finally, I had to push my beanie up above my ears. The first benefit of winter running made itself sweatily apparent to me: You’ll never be warmer in winter than when you’re running outside.Running is always a bit of a Sisyphean exercise, something that non-runners are quick to point out. Unlike other sports — which at least involve balls, nets, and winning — running, at least the non-race variety, is pointless. We leave home, travel far, and exert ourselves enormously with the sole purpose of returning to where we started.The sense of accomplishment that comes with putting away a few miles in single-digit temperatures is the best runner’s high I’ve ever had.Never is this more true than in winter. Your pace is slowed; you are not going to set any personal records running on snow or ice. Breathing cold air can be shockingly painful. Parts of you that you didn’t know could freeze do exactly that. In Maine, I was stunned by the sudden sensation of crunchiness inside my nostrils. What is that? I wondered. Had I inhaled some kind of tiny, rocky particle? The truth was my nose hairs were frozen.But despite all the challenges — in fact, perhaps even because of them — winter running has become my favorite kind of running. It is a distillation of what I love most about this sport.When I started running a few years ago, it seemed borderline impossible. I felt weak and slow, and every time I went out, I thought I might die from the combination of boredom and extreme exertion. But I kept going because I got a taste of a feeling that no other sport had provided me: the awareness of my body as an engine, capable of carrying me many miles on my own two feet. It is a democratic awareness, available to every person who runs, whether they are an elite marathoner or they put in two 14-minute-miles once a week. No matter who you are, when you run, your feet alone carry you. Your body is a perfect, self-sufficient machine.In exchange for its obstacles, winter running offers this feeling in abundance. If running during the rest of the year makes you feel like a small, efficient car, winter running makes you feel like a tank — an invincible, self-heating force capable of rolling miles across an actual tundra. The sense of accomplishment that comes with putting away a few miles in single-digit temperatures is the best runner’s high I’ve ever had. And the extremity of the conditions — icy air in your lungs, wind scraping at your face, and if you’re lucky, sun glinting off the snow into your eyes — forces a kind of mindfulness that can be hard to come by in warmer weather. I have rarely felt so connected to my body as I do when I run in the cold.And, of course, it’s not just that winter running provides some ephemeral good feelings. As Markham Heid has written for Elemental, research suggests there are myriad health benefits to exercising in cold weather. First, there is the vitamin D gained from sun exposure — not easy to come by in the winter months and crucial for everything from bone composition to mood regulation. Cold-weather exercise doesn’t elevate your heart rate the way that working out in the heat does, which means you might actually be able to run farther, and for longer, than you can in the summer—with greater comfort.Finally, there are the mood-boosting endorphins, which are produced at a higher rate when your body has to work to warm itself up and which, along with vitamin D, are more important than ever in winter, when the days are shorter and challenges like seasonal affective disorder creep in. It turns out that winter running is more than just philosophically admirable: It’s scientifically proven to be a good idea too.The GPS record of my runs across the lake in Maine have a peculiar, almost unreal look to them; most display as a straight line through a mass of blue nothingness. “Wow!” my cousin Jeff commented on the map of my first trip out on Lake Hebron. “That looks like a run to nowhere!”He wasn’t wrong. But sometimes nowhere feels good.A few tips for the winter-running curious: Dress as though you’re going for a walk in 20-degrees-warmer weather. (You should be cold for the first five minutes. If you’re not, that’s a sign you’re going to overheat!) Ice cleats — a simple set of straps you attach to your regular running sneakers — are a game-changer for running on frozen surfaces. Don’t forget a hat, gloves, and something for your neck (I like a thin gaiter). Finally, wear clothing you can unzip, unsnap, or otherwise adjust — it gets warm out there when you’re running in winter!Written by"
69,"For Women, Moderate Exercise Might Be Best","The typical clichés around exercise are that his idea of getting in shape is pumping iron, while she’d rather pull out the yoga mat. These are indeed stereotypes and there are plenty of women who rave about their latest triathlon and many men who are amazing yogis. However, there are real physiological differences between the sexes that may cause different responses to exercise.A most substantial contributing factor to these differences depends on something called “muscle fiber type” and how our sex hormones affect it.There are two types of muscle fibers: Type I fibers, which are great for long, sustained activity; and Type II fibers, which are well-suited for shorter, intense activity. Men possess a higher percentage of Type II fibers which, when combined with higher testosterone levels, makes them excel at “explosive performance,” or short, intense bursts of effort, like sprinting or high-intensity interval training (HIIT).Women, on the other hand, tend to have a higher proportion of Type I muscle fibers, as well as greater capillary density. This combo allows us to circulate more blood throughout our muscle tissue, and to use our glucose for sustained energy. In addition, our fat deposits are more easily broken down and converted into energy than a man’s, allowing us to go longer, stronger. This makes us better at endurance training. Or to put it simply, women need to exercise for longer periods at lower intensity in order to boost metabolism and optimize aerobic fitness.This is not to say that women should lift lighter dumbbells or ditch the chin-ups. Obviously, there are plenty of women who can do all of that and much more.In the exercise world, low-to-moderate intensity exercise is anything that ups your heart rate, making you sweat lightly rather than profusely. At this rate, you can carry on a conversation, albeit a little breathily, but you couldn’t belt out a tune if you tried. In comparison, during high-intensity exercise such as a spin class, one can get out a few words here and there, but not carry on a full conversation.This is not to say that women should lift lighter dumbbells or ditch the chin-ups. Obviously, there are plenty of women who can do all of that and much more. But as a rule of thumb, both the American College of Sports Medicine and the American Heart Health Association recommend exercising three to five days a week, then adjust the duration of the workout based on your age and overall health, including your fitness level, personal goals, risks, and medications. Age and menopausal status are big factors to consider, whether you’re adjusting your current routine or starting a new one.Several studies have shown that low-to-moderate intensity exercise in these amounts optimizes metabolic performance in women, especially when sustained over time. The workouts simultaneously strike a delicate balance between glucose and fat utilization, while at the same time boosting hormonal levels. Interestingly, in some studies, tweaking one’s activity to these specs produced a hormonal improvement so pronounced that it alone dramatically decreased both the number and severity of menopausal hot flashes. In one study of 3,500 women, those who engaged in moderate-intensity exercise for a minimum of 30 minutes a few times a week, were 28% less likely to have severe hot flashes than those who exercised less. Active women were also 17% less likely to feel sad or depressed while at the same time resisting weight gain or risking obesity.Moderate exercise can also have broader implications for overall health: While occasional, high-intensity exercise can increase inflammation, continued, regular exercise turns it down instead, increasing your defenses against a variety of diseases.I’ve heard it said that the modern, urban woman here in the States has two modes: sitting or spinning — with little in between! As it turns out, your brain actually prefers a gentler, more everyday variety of movement, and the slow, steady burn it delivers. This fact reiterates that, for women in particular, it’s not about intensity as much as frequency and consistency.I encourage women to experiment with everyday movement as an integral part of their overall well-being, rather than fixating on time spent inside a gym. If you feel like your life leaves you no time for things like walking to the store or taking the stairs instead of the elevator, it’s time to step back and see what can be done. Strangely, the stress and fatigue we struggle with in modern life typically have more to do with what we aren’t doing, rather than doing too much.Written by"
70,"Nootropics for Productivity, Relaxation, and Social Enhancement","One of the most popular articles I ever published was my interview with Mike and Marius, two of the more high-profile bloggers in the nootropics community. The two of them shared some truly incredible information about how to use commercially available dietary supplements to improve your focus and maximize productivity.Since then, I’ve had quite a few requests for more nootropics content. And truth be told, I’ve been dying to talk to more nootropics experts myself. Today’s expert is Jonathan Roseland, the proprietor of Limitless Mindset. He has been experimenting with nootropics for nearly a decade now and has probably tried more of them than anyone else I’ve ever spoken to.Jonathan describes himself as an adventuring philosopher, pompous pontificator, writer, K-selected biohacker, tantric husband, raconteur, and smart drug dealer. And, as I found out, he’s into quite a bit more than just nootropics.The scope of this interview is somewhat broader than the last one — as you’ll see, Jonathan uses nootropics not only for productivity but also for sleep, relaxation, and social enhancement. He also shares a couple of little-known technological (nondrug) tools that he uses to help him focus and get the most value he possibly can out of the nootropics he uses.Some nootropics—like caffeine—are well-studied and widely used. More research is needed on many others, and on the effects of mixing or stacking nootropics. While Jonathan’s experience is helpful in considering which nootropics might be beneficial to you, neither of us is a medical doctor. It’s always a good idea to discuss potential supplements with your own doctor.It was the movie “Limitless” with Bradley Cooper that came out about nine years ago. I watched that movie and was just totally inspired by the idea of a drug that could unlock your mind. And since then, I’ve dived deeply and passionately into this topic of nootropics, and I’ve tried over 100 different nootropics at this point.I give them typically at least a month, unless they are just awful. And there are a couple I’ve tried that were not good, and I had to quit early. But typically I feel like I need at least a month to really try something.Of the ones I hated and had to stop early, Sunifiram stands out. It was really no good. There were also a couple of nootropic stacks (capsules combining multiple nootropics) I felt crappy on and had to quit after a couple of days.As you can imagine, I now have companies emailing me all the time offering me nootropic products to try, so I’ve developed a system for filtering them to determine which ones I’m willing to even take free samples from. First and foremost, I ask the companies to send me the CoA (Certificate of Analysis) for their products so I can check for heavy-metal toxicity.I also check if they’re using patented ingredients. If they don’t provide the CoA and they’re not using patented ingredients, I don’t trust it.A lot of times you can tell from the label. If the label says “proprietary blend,” and it lists 10 or 20 different things but doesn’t list quantities — particularly trendy ingredients like Panax Ginseng or Gingko biloba — that’s a red flag.Typically, if a company is going to make the effort to source high-quality ginseng and Gingko biloba and include it in significant quantities, they’re going to display the actual quantities — and maybe mention something about the derivative that they use or the concentration it’s in.So if it’s a product that costs something like $33.99 and they have a ton of ingredients listed but not quantities and no CoAs, I’m going to pass on that.I also look at the safety of the listed ingredients. A company emailed me recently with a stack product that contained, like, 400 micrograms (mcg) per serving of huperzine, which is just a ton of it—way too much. It’s normally 200 mcg or lower. If you’re going to have a daily stack with huperzine, I’d want like 50 mcg of it. For occasional use, 100-200 mcg is OK, but for daily use, I’d want it lower since it builds up over time.But manufacturers love huperzine because it’s cheap — it’s one of the cheapest stimulants out there — and it gives people a buzz, so it makes it feel like the supplements are doing more. So they use huperzine to pad the perceived value of their nootropic stacks, but they don’t think enough about safety.I also see a lot of people get into selling nootropic stacks who aren’t really experts in it. They might have a really good personal development brand, but then they dilute it by selling these crappy supplements.Yeah, I have a complicated relationship with modafinil. I do use it from time to time because it is a powerful nootropic and wakefulness enhancer. But it’s far from the first thing I’d recommend to someone, especially if they’re new to nootropics, because its mechanism is something that floods your brain with a lot of histamine.Histamine is a complicated neurotransmitter. And it’s not just a neurotransmitter — it’s also a hormone that has a lot to do with the immune system. Histamine is the reason you itch when you get bitten by a mosquito. It’s what causes allergic reactions. So because of this excessive amount of histamine, modafinil can have all sorts of (often allergylike) side effects that can be bad for people.I do sentiment analyses where I scout the internet for anecdotal reports on a nootropic. I’ll look at Reddit, LongeCity, Blue Light — sites like that — and see what people are saying about a drug or supplement, and modafinil has a pretty high proportion of people who are responding negatively to it.With something like piracetam, I’ll see that maybe 15-20% of people are having a negative or maybe neutral or underwhelmed response to it, but with modafinil, it’s more like 40-50% are having a negative response.Modafinil also has a rather steep tolerance curve. That’s based on anecdote mainly — I don’t know if there are studies — but people build up a tolerance to it very quickly.I wrote an article called “Modafinil is Problematic,” where I made the case against modafinil. It’s what I call an anti-empathy drug. It puts you into such a logical state that it makes you very odd in personal interactions. I’ve experienced this, and a lot of people around the internet have reported it too.My wife doesn’t like when I do modafinil because our interactions are just odd. We don’t have a very nice day together — she just leaves me alone to work in my office when I’m on it.The final reason is it can really mess with people’s sleep. It’s a powerful antinarcoleptic with a very long half-life, so I’ll advise people to take it first thing in the morning, like 6 a.m., and not redose later in the day. And I favor lower dosages.One upside that is rarely discussed is it can make sex really great, surprisingly, because it upregulates dopamine a lot. But you have to have sex when it’s in your system in large quantities, meaning morning sex — ideally about two hours after taking modafinil. And, of course, the anti-empathy effects don’t synergize with this too well.I don’t find that this makes sex without modafinil any less pleasurable either. Of course, I’m not using it very often.Yeah, definitely. I’ll have typically like half a tab of armodafinil (that’s the stronger right-handed isomer of modafinil) first thing in the morning — and have a cup of coffee with that.I’ll combine that with a little bit of nicotine, because I find nicotine complements modafinil pretty nicely, but it’s a much more short-burning stimulant. I can have some nicotine in the afternoon as the modafinil and caffeine start to wind down, and it’ll be gone well before bedtime.Piracetam. Often there’s an almost immediate effect with piracetam: a stimulating, cognition-enhancing effect on the first day. Not always — but often.There’s also a more long-term effect of unlocking your long-term memory, where you start to remember stuff from years ago. That usually kicks in after two to four weeks of daily use, at around a gram and a half to three grams a day.That sounds kind of expensive, but you can get like 500 grams of pharmaceutical-grade stuff for like $39. So it’s really not that expensive at all.John’s note: That price would be for raw powder, not encapsulated. Piracetam doesn’t taste terrible — nor does it taste good. It’s not too hard to mix with some water, juice, or Gatorade and pound back, though. Due to the low half-life, most users divide their dose between 2-3 daily doses.I like to call Rhodiola rosea an herbal alternative to modafinil. There have been some studies on it — there was a study that was with nursing students who were shift workers in a hospital, and they found that Rhodiola was a pretty good wakefulness agent.Rhodiola kind of stands out as an adaptogen, in that it seems to adjust the balance of the sympathetic and parasympathetic parts of the nervous system up and down as needed. For people who are chronically stressed, it helps them adjust up and down so they can relax when they want to, but they can activate that fight-or-flight response when they need it.Rhodiola is one of my favorite herbs, and I usually prefer it over modafinil. Modafinil does have its place, as long as you don’t have issues with histamine reactions, but Rhodiola is probably a better wakefulness promoter.I take Rhodiola a bit differently from most people. It’s most commonly consumed it in pills, but I prefer powdered Rhodiola mixed with tea.John’s note: The whole concept of adaptogens — chemicals that improve the body’s stress response and can have stimulant or depressant effects depending on the body’s needs — is controversial. Research evidence is mixed, and the term adaptogen is currently not widely accepted in mainstream medical practice.I found two different studies that Jonathan might have been thinking of. One study done on physicians found significant reductions in fatigue from Rhodiola rosea.However, another study on nursing students actually found the group that took Rhodiola suffered from worse fatigue over time than the placebo group.The dosage used in the nursing student study was rather high, and it was taken in mornings. To me, this suggests Rhodiola acted more as a stimulant than an adaptogen, and it has a long enough half-life that a high dose taken in the morning can impair sleep that night. That would explain why it led to worse long-term fatigue. Like modafinil, it could make you less fatigued in the short term, but chronic use could make you more fatigued in the long term from lack of sleep.This doesn’t preclude the possibility that it’s an adaptogen at lower doses, but there’s no real proof of that. For now, I could view it as a stimulant that acts like a weaker modafinil — albeit without the histamine-related side effects.Nicotine is pretty good for that. It’s somewhat addictive. It’s an associative kind of drug that your brain learns to associate with things.I have a morning ritual figured out where I’ll get up, walk the dog, make my coffee, and then I’ll have a drop of nicotine. I use a propenyl-glycol solution that’s, like, 5% nicotine, and I’ll put a drop underneath my tongue and wash it down with the coffee — nicotine really doesn’t taste good.I’m not a big fan of vaping and, of course, not cigarettes because of the carcinogenic concerns and all the other chemicals in them.Yeah, exactly. Your brain associates the pleasure from the nicotine with whatever else is happening at the time. It’s not unlike how people like to have a cigarette after sex.I used to be a smoker. Not like a pack a day — but a social smoker — and smoking socially definitely does condition people to be more social.Since I started using the liquid nicotine, I never crave cigarettes anymore — not even when I’m at parties (which is when I used to smoke).I’ve never used nicotine patches; I prefer the liquid solution. They’re good for lucid dreaming from what I hear, if you can sleep. Since patches hit your bloodstream slower, they’re less addictive but also less associative.I find nicotine helps me a lot with productivity in general, but it’s even better with creative work.I particularly like algorithmic music. For example, the music of brain.fm. It’s one of the better productivity tools that I’ve found. It’s this website and app that produces really cool, algorithmic, electronic music that really puts you in a productive headspace.The Pomodoro technique has never really made sense to me. I’ll work for like an hour — hour and a half — before taking a short break. I don’t see the need to plan on taking a break I don’t need. Maybe I haven’t experimented with it enough, but I remember trying it and not being impressed.I do practice the 20/20/20 technique, where every 20 minutes, I look up for 20 seconds at something 20 feet away.I think I have a pretty ketogenic lifestyle because I almost always skip breakfast and do a 16-hour daily fast. And I’ve tried a few different ketone products. I’ve found the intermittent daily fasting hasn’t affected my productivity that much and neither have the ketone products.I do the occasional 24-hour fast for health purposes, as does my wife, and I’ve started using the ketones just in the last eight hours of those fasts. Because in those last eight hours, you’re really kind of running on fumes.I do want to experiment with ketones more — but not for productivity because I haven’t found them to make much difference there. But they help with longer fasts, to get some extra calories in that are bypassing your metabolism, without breaking ketosis.John’s note: After asking a few clarifying questions here, I found out Jonathan doesn’t eat low-carb at all and hasn’t measured his ketone levels in any way. He’s probably not really in ketosis to any significant degree during these 16-hour fasts. Maybe he gets a little into ketosis in the 24-hour fasts.But what he’s experiencing with the daily fasts, if anything, is simply the effects of being in a fasted state — that is, not having the sedating effect from digesting food. That’s different from ketosis, although they sometimes go hand in hand. Fasting is a useful productivity tool for some people.The one that really stands out is phenibut. It’s a higher-risk nootropic, but for a lot of people, it makes them social butterflies. It really releases them from their inhibitions. You do have to find a sweet spot with it, though — where it reduces your inhibitions, but you don’t get intoxicated.You should stay away from alcohol when you’re on it. For social purposes, if you’re using phenibut only once or twice a week, a good dose for most people is like 750 milligrams. That’s what I would do.I went on a vacation to the Black Sea a while ago. My wife and I would do about 500 mg each together — to take the edge off while we were hanging out on the beach. So that’s about a threshold dose.I like the Peak Nootropics brand. They have a CoA — I’d go with anyone who offers a CoA.Phenibut is a very pleasant nootropic. And it has kind of a tangy taste — you can mix it with fruit juice or anything fruit-flavored. I’d be comfortable mixing it with a drink at a party, instead of alcohol.I’ve had conflicting experiences with this. There was a time in Berlin a few years ago when I took some phenibut, went barhopping with my roommates, and didn’t drink but just had the phenibut. And between it and the fatigue from being out, I slept in until 4 p.m. the next day.But it’s inconsistent — there were nights when I haven’t been able to sleep, too. And it can cause hangovers into the next day and make you way oversleep like that one night in Berlin. I wouldn’t really recommend it for sleep. There are better options.Racetams — other nootropics in the same family as piracetamOxiracetam — the discipline molecule. It helps you stay focused and disciplined for about 6-8 hours. It doesn’t really have an acute, noticeable effect like other nootropics. You’ll just notice you’re less distractible and you make better decisions on it.What about noopept? It’s not a racetam, but it’s closely related and often gets lumped in with racetams.Yeah, I’ve used it in stacks, but I wouldn’t use it on its own. It just doesn’t have much of an effect for me, personally.How about kratom? That’s a big topic of discussion these days.Oh yeah, kratom’s an interesting one. I had shied away from kratom for a long time because none of the sources were doing spectroscopy analysis, and they were all in these shady third-world countries. So that’s a recipe for toxicity.However, there was a company that emailed me recently that sent me their certificates of analysis, and they looked pretty legit. So that makes me hopeful that you could find trustworthy kratom.But I’m not interested in it after all because it’s opioid-adjacent — it works on the opioid receptors, and it’s addictive. I wouldn’t use it unless maybe I was recovering from PTSD or something.John’s note: While not an opioid as such, kratom does have alkaloids that act on the opioid receptors. That makes it useful for weaning people off opioids — and as a nonpharmaceutical painkiller — but yes, it’s addictive.Kratom lovers claim to get around this by having 7-10 different strains of kratom and rotating between them since different strains have different mixes of alkaloids. I don’t know how well this works. Personally, I’d do the rotation but also only use kratom 3-4 days a week.How about ashwagandha?I’m a huge fan of ashwagandha. I do it almost daily as a sleep supplement. It can help with socializing, but I think phenibut is just so much better for that.What about Methylene blue? Is there anything to the claim that it enhances your mitochondria?It is used as a mitochondria booster. Dave Asprey wrote about it. I used it for about a month, and I didn’t notice anything that would make me want to order it again.John’s note: Same here. It does act as an electron donor for mitochondria, which should give you more energy, but I never noticed anything from it other than my pee turning blue. My guess is that what it aids with isn’t the rate-limiting step in mitochondrial glycolysis — in other words, it’s probably doing something but not something that matters much in practice.Let’s hear your experiences with Alpha-GPC.Yeah, so Alpha-GPC is the rich man’s choline precursor. It’s the most bioavailable.As far as acetylcholine precursors go, there are two options: CDP-choline and Alpha-GPC. There are other choline precursors, but those two are the best. And the response is a little bit different between them.Alpha-GPC is a little bit more of a classic cognitive enhancer. And then CDP-choline — that’s going to be a little bit more stimulating.So if you want to do something like write a book or work on a website, you’d want to take some Alpha-GPC alongside your racetams. But if you were doing something more high-energy — like maybe if you’re a salesperson and you’ve got a big day of meetings and sales calls — then CDP-choline is going to serve you better.How about the classic caffeine and theanine stack? Do you still use that or has other stuff superseded it for you? And how much caffeine do you consume?That is still a reliable workhorse stack. I like it, and caffeinewise, I have typically one or two cups of tea or coffee a day. I don’t supplement theanine much, but I get a fair amount of it from green tea. It’s good — there’s just other stuff I use instead.I don’t take tolerance breaks from caffeine very often. I don’t build up much of a tolerance since I’m only having a cup or two a day.When I was in Colombia, I did go through a phase where I had about five cups of coffee a day. Coming off of that was rough.Have you tried reishi mushrooms? Or that coffee that has reishi mushrooms in it?Not much. Reishi is not really a classic nootropic that would stimulate you. It’s more of an anxiolytic (antianxiety) supplement. I think it’s best for helping people get to sleep when they have anxiety or are overstimulated.I can see why people would put it in coffee — the reishi would take the edge off the caffeine. It’s doing kind of the same thing as the caffeine and theanine stack but by different mechanisms.Reishi is also an immune enhancer. Not sure how that plays into the nootropic effects, though.You mentioned huperzine A earlier — what do you use that for?I only use it in stack products, not on its own. And only if the dosage is very small. Other than that, I don’t go out of my way to use it.I haven’t experimented much with it on its own. I know there’s a number of negative side effects from it if you let it accumulate in your system. So I prefer to just avoid it.What’s your daily stack right now?Mainly, I’m using a stack supplement called Quantumind by Filtered Formulas. That and caffeine, of course. Other than that, there’s stuff I use occasionally — but not daily.I start with a low, conservative dosage for a day or two. Then, I increase that to the median or recommended dosage for a few days. And if that’s not overstimulating, I’ll try a high dosage for a day or two.As far as measuring the effects, I use Dual N-Back brain-training software for that. It’s this brain game you can play on your smartphone or computer. I think it’s the brain game that has the strongest clinical evidence for it as being something that objectively measures working memory, cognitive performance, and executive functioning. And importantly, it does have transfer effects to tasks and general intelligence outside of the brain game.When I do the Dual N-Back on different nootropics, there’s usually a clear impact on my performance at the game. Like with modafinil, a very potent cognitive enhancer, there really does seem to be an uptick.Like Jonathan says, really experimenting with nootropics takes time — at least a week, and probably more like a month, to test out a new supplement.If a lot of this is new to you, the first things you should do are try out the algorithmic music and the Dual N-Back software Jonathan recommends. Truth be told, these were the most mind-blowing parts of the interview for me. I can attest the algorithmic music really works for me, even if I don’t understand how.After that, I recommend trying out some of the more accessible, safer nootropics. That means not modafinil, which is a prescription drug and can impair sleep, and not phenibut or kratom, which are potentially addictive.Out of what we discussed here, the best nootropics to start with, in my opinion, are the caffeine-plus-theanine combo, ashwagandha, Alpha-GPC, piracetam, oxiracetam, and Rhodiola rosea.Personally, I’m really excited to try oxiracetam.

71,Does Blue Light From Screens Really Ruin Sleep?,"For more information on the novel coronavirus and Covid-19, visit cdc.gov.This story is a part of Elemental Light Week, a five-day series on what light does for your body, brain, and well-being.Dreaded short-wavelength “blue” light from smartphones and other screens is supposedly creating a generation of sleepless zombies, spurring the creation of “night mode” apps that tamp down cold blue light and infuse smartphone screens with warmer yellows and reds. But as with zombies, some things appear different in the scientific light of day.Studies reveal that light at night, especially blue light, can negatively affect sleep duration and quality. But some scientists say light from smartphones, tablets, computers, and TVs before bedtime is just one ingredient — and quite possibly a relatively minor one — in the recipe of environmental and behavioral monsters that keep people up at night.The common recommendation to turn off screens two to three hours before bedtime remains good advice for kids and for anyone who struggles to fall asleep. But it fails to take into account the way humans are messing with their biological clocks by spending entire days indoors, in relatively dim lighting, leaving a body with no clue when it’s time to go to sleep.“Get outdoors or sit by a window for at least two hours a day, and you probably don’t have to worry about what you look at in the home at night,” says Mark Rea, PhD, a professor of architecture and cognitive sciences at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute’s Lighting Research Center. “Your ability to sleep at night [will improve] and your sleepiness during the day will be much dissipated if you follow that simple recipe.”Not every scientist agrees entirely with that bold statement. But in multiple interviews and reviews of the scientific literature on the topic, it’s clear that screens at night are not as evil as we’ve been led to believe.Humans, like all creatures and even plants, have an internal biological clock attuned to the cycle of night and day. Our circadian rhythm, as it’s called, runs on a roughly 24-hour cycle when properly tuned, though it varies by individual (hence, night owls).In the course of human evolution, only recently have we been exposed to significant light at night beyond fires in caves or torches in castles. So the circadian rhythm is deeply rooted in long-evolved internal or “endogenous” controls residing in the brain’s hypothalamus, explains Ari Shechter, PhD, an assistant professor in the Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health at Columbia University Medical Center. It’s also sensitive to outside factors, called “zeitgebers,” which can change the timing or the expression of the system.Daylight and darkness are the chief zeitgebers. Darkness triggers the brain’s production of melatonin, a hormone that promotes sleep. Bright light suppresses melatonin production.But not all light is the same, Shechter explains. In fact, the retina, where light is converted into neural signals at the back of the eye, is particularly sensitive to short-wavelength light that we perceive as blue. The effects are two-fold:“Exposure to light within this range [at night] can delay the timing of melatonin and reduce its overall secretion,” Shechter says. “This short-wavelength light can also increase our neurocognitive alertness.”Shechter and colleagues tested the effects of blue light at night by having adults who had been diagnosed with insomnia wear amber-tinted glasses, which blocked about 65% of the short-wavelength light, for two hours before bedtime over seven nights. Others followed the same protocol but wore “placebo” glasses that didn’t filter any light. After seven nights, each person switched to the other type of glasses and repeated the experiment. When wearing the amber glasses, people got about 30 minutes more sleep and said they slept better and more soundly compared to when they wore the non-filtering glasses.But Shechter is cautious about interpreting the findings, detailed in the Journal of Psychiatric Research. While blue light may have a greater effect on the circadian system than other colors in the spectrum, “overall brightness is very important as well,” he says. And because the participants in his study had symptoms of insomnia, the findings don’t indicate whether light-filtering glasses at night would improve sleep for others.In a similar experiment, people wore glasses that blocked short-wavelength light three hours before bedtime, and they wore sleep and activity monitors 24 hours a day. After two weeks, their nighttime, sleep-inducing melatonin levels were 58% higher than before the experiment began. They were sleeping an extra 24 minutes and reported falling asleep faster and sleeping better, the researchers reported in the journal Ophthalmic and Physiological Optics.“The most important takeaway is that blue light at nighttime really does decrease sleep quality,” says study leader Lisa Ostrin, PhD, an optometrist and researcher at the University of Houston College of Optometry. However, Ostrin adds, “Our findings were a result of filtering all sources of artificial light, including room lights, street lights, and screens. Filtering blue light from screens is likely beneficial for sleep, but filtering all artificial light will provide the greatest benefit.”Both studies, however, were small, involving 14 and 22 people, respectively. The bottom line: There’s little evidence that using apps or glasses specifically to filter blue light from your devices at night will offer much benefit.Less research has been done on the effectiveness of night-mode apps. But in one significant study done at Rensselaer’s Lighting Research Center, scientists tested the iPad’s night-shift mode in young adults, finding that it alone was not sufficient in limiting light’s effect on melatonin levels but that instead, overall screen brightness needs to be turned down.Still, many experts suggest night mode could help people who have difficulty sleeping.“It seems that using a night-mode-type setting can help to maintain proper nighttime melatonin secretion,” Shechter says. “But more studies need to be done. A very important point to remember when using night mode, however, is that it is not just the spectral composition of the light (i.e., the wavelength) that influences our circadian system but also the overall brightness of the light. So it is not enough to just turn on the night mode and leave the brightness of the device at a high setting. To try and achieve the best results, you should use the night mode but also lower the brightness to a very low level.”Light is like a cup of coffee, says William Killgore, PhD, a psychiatry professor at the University of Arizona.“Light is not necessarily good or bad in and of itself,” Killgore says. “Like caffeine, it all comes down to when you use it. It can be terrible for your sleep if you’re consuming coffee at 10 o’clock at night, but it may be great for your alertness if you have it in the morning.” Likewise: “You don’t want melatonin in the morning because it makes you drowsy and prepares the brain to sleep.”In fact, blue light’s effect on the circadian system goes well beyond the sleep-wake cycle. “The circadian rhythm is one of the most powerful influences on human behavior,” Killgore says. “Humans evolved on a planet for millions of years with a 24-hour light/dark cycle, and that’s deeply ingrained in all our cells,” he says.In a new study published in the February 2020 issue of the journal Neurobiology of Disease, Killgore and colleagues reveal the power of blue light at the right time — in the morning. In a randomized clinical trial of people who had suffered mild traumatic brain injury due to a recent concussion or other head injury, Killgore’s team exposed one group to bright blue light for 30 minutes early each morning. After six weeks, the participants were sleeping and waking earlier, reporting less daytime sleepiness, and improved on tests of brain speed and efficiency, compared with a control group that was exposed to bright amber light. Also, neural connections in parts of the brain that drive alertness and connection were strengthened.“Daily exposure to blue-wavelength light each morning helps to re-entrain the circadian rhythm so that people get better, more regular sleep,” Killgore says. “This is likely true for everybody.”Another small study exposed 15 college students to bright light in the morning, either white light or blue-enriched light. “The decline of melatonin levels was significantly greater after the exposure to blue-enriched white light in comparison with warm white light,” the researchers concluded last year in the journal Scientific Reports.Popular articles and even scientific papers on the effects of light often don’t mention the critical importance of this contrast: the ratio of daytime light intensity and duration to the amount and duration of indoor lighting and screens at night, says Rea, the Lighting Research Center scientist.“If I have bright light during the day, the impact on my circadian rhythm at night by a given light will be relatively insignificant,” Rea says. “But if I spend all day in a dim room, then that same amount of light at night can begin to be disruptive to the wake and sleep patterns and digestion and all sorts of other things.”Among the few studies to look into this, a small one involving 14 participants found that two hours of reading on a 10.1-inch color tablet (the ASUS Transformer Pad TF700) at full brightness in the evening after six and a half hours of exposure to bright light during the day did not affect sleep. “Light exposure during the day could have had a protective effect against screen light in the evening,” says study leader Frida Rångtell, PhD, a sleep researcher formerly at Uppsala University in Sweden who is now starting her own sleep health business. But, Rångtell notes, there’s not enough science for a definitive answer.“The modern lifestyle is set up so that a combination of factors can disrupt our circadian rhythms,” says Laura Fonken, PhD, a University of Texas at Austin researcher who has studied the effects of light on the circadian system and metabolism.“Sure, lighting from screens plays a part in this, but other factors also certainly contribute. For example, when you eat, exercise, answer stressful emails … that can all influence endogenous hormonal signals that feed back on your circadian clock. Light is the most important factor for synchronizing your circadian clock, but it is not the only factor that influences circadian rhythms.”The effect of light on the circadian system depends not on the intrinsic brightness of a source but what reaches the eye. Just glance directly at a light bulb in an otherwise dim room and then look the other way to grasp the difference. This illuminance at the eye is measured in lux — a highly complex measure of the quantity of light.On a bright, sunny day, your eyes may receive 10,000 lux or more, experts say. Even on a cloudy day, you’ll likely get at least 1,000 lux. Either provides a strong dose of melatonin suppression. By contrast, typical indoor lighting produces somewhere between 100 and 250 lux at the eye while standard office lighting may range up to around 500 lux.Screens deliver much less, according to data on 20 devices provided to Elemental by Rea at the Lighting Research Center. At full brightness in color, typical screens in your home deliver anywhere from 37.8 lux to less than one lux at normal viewing distances.Some of Rea’s data:A black-and-white e-reader at full brightness likely delivers no more than 15 lux, Rea says, though he doesn’t have test data on e-readers.For adults, it takes about 350 to 500 lux at the eyes to significantly trigger the circadian system to promote significant daytime wakefulness and, in turn, promote nighttime sleep, Rea says. “You can get 30 lux at night, and it won’t make any difference,” he says. “The circadian system needs to know the difference between light and dark, day and night.”In a 2014 study led by Mariana Figueiro, Rea’s colleague and director of the Lighting Research Center, people sitting six to nine feet from a 70-inch TV for 90 minutes experienced no significant suppression of melatonin. In another from 2012, two hours of nighttime exposure to a computer screen delivering 30 lux to the eyes had the same lack of effect.But in a later study also led by Figueiro, evening time spent on smartphones, computers, TVs and other screens did suppress melatonin levels in teens age 15 to 17, by 23% after one hour and 38% after two hours. “Compared to our previous studies, these results suggest that adolescents may be more sensitive to light than other populations,” the researchers concluded.Limiting screen time before bedtime and during the day makes sense for children, according to Stanford Children’s Health and others and not just for the effect on the circadian system. Limiting screen time is good for overall eye health and encourages kids to be more active, “burning through their natural physical energy, which makes it easier to settle down at bedtime,” the center notes.Yet it’s hard to imagine any amount of research will discourage the use of screens at night among adults. Fonken, the University of Texas researcher, is a case in point. “Even as a circadian researcher who knows that exposure to light at night is not optimal, I still check my smartphone right before going to sleep because of societal pressures to stay connected,” she says. But she advises people who rarely, if ever, get outside to aim to get more true daylight so their internal clock knows what time it is. And in addition to smartphone night apps and overall screen dimming, she suggests considering smart light bulbs that allow you to shift room lighting to warmer hues at night.Or, if you’re a lighting Luddite, simply dial down the dimmer switch or turn some room lights off while you’re absorbed in your favorite zombie movie or… wait, be careful what you allow on your screens late at night.Rea recalls not being able to sleep after his alma mater, Ohio State, lost to Clemson 29–23 in the nighttime Fiesta Bowl in December, owing to what many analysts agreed were a series of bad calls by the refs. “I was upset,” he says. “It wasn’t the light. It was all those bad calls.” On reflection, he notes the potential positive flipside of a little screen time at night: Reading something soothing or even boring can be soporific. “If it’s a bad enough thesis, I can go to sleep right away.”Written by"
72,How Much Sugar Can We Eat?,"For more information on the novel coronavirus and Covid-19, visit cdc.gov.When I was writing for the Opinion section of the Times, I had a number of close advisors. On nutrition matters, I came to rely more and more heavily on David Katz. Later, we became friends and, in 2018, I asked him to sit down and talk with me about how we should be eating, for a Grub Street piece which ran (untruthfully) as “The Last Conversation You’ll Ever Need to Have About Eating Right.”The response was tremendous, as one of the most-read articles of the year — not just in food; not just for New York Magazine, but online, period.What we didn’t realize until then, was the degree to which people are looking for guidance on how to eat from people they can trust. And that we qualified.The net result is our new book, “How to Eat: All Your Food and Diet Questions Answered.” In it, we answer what we gathered and hope are the most pressing questions about diet that confront many readers. We think it’s a useful tool to understand, commit to and maintain a truly healthy diet, and one that will serve as a useful counter to all the bullshit out there. Here’s our second excerpt.“How to Eat” by Mark Bittman and David L. Katz, M.D., is published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is available here on March 3.No. Although we understand why you’re asking that, since there’ve been two major fads that renounced fruit in recent years. The first was the glycemic index; the second, fear-mongering about fructose.“The glycemic index is a measure of how much a fixed amount of sugar in various foods raises our blood sugar. High blood sugar, which can lead to diabetes, is a bad and dangerous thing.There’s a relatively high glycemic index for some fruits, and even for some vegetables. The conclusion was that these fruits drive up blood sugar, and the next conclusion was that fruit must increase the risk of diabetes.Not to mention that the fear over glycemic index also extends to vegetables like carrots.No. The measure has value, but judging a food based only on the glycemic index would be like judging a person’s character based solely on, say, shoe size or bowling average. The glycemic index measures how much blood sugar goes up from the same amount of sugar in different foods. The problem with assigning that measure to fruit or carrots is that to get to the same amount of sugar from carrots and ice cream, you need a very tiny serving of ice cream versus a lot of carrots.Judging a food based only on the glycemic index would be like judging a person’s character based solely on, say, shoe size or bowling average.It doesn’t account for the concentration of the sugar. This is the crucial distinction. Imagine, for instance, if we told you one person weighed 100 pounds and another weighed 200 pounds and then we asked you: “Who’s overweight?”But what if we now told you that the 100-pound person was a 5-year-old boy, and the 200-pound was a 6-foot-5-inch man. That turns the tables: The man is very lean, while the child is seemingly obese, and thus “heavier” relative to height. Sugar is present in carrots, but it’s pretty dilute. It’s concentrated in ice cream. The glycemic index misses that distinction.Yes: the glycemic load. That does account for the concentration of sugar in a food, essentially adjusting for sugar concentration the way the body mass index (BMI) adjusts weight for height.No. Studies have found an association between routine consumption of whole fruit and lower risk of obesity and diabetes. No one becomes obese or diabetic from eating carrots! We are generally making a mistake when we become obsessed with just one measure, any one measure, and think it’s all that matters about a food.Our fixation on fructose is a variation of our obsession with the glycemic index. Many people started highlighting the potential harms of fructose. But fructose is fruit sugar. So it’s in apples, bananas, peaches, and every other fruit. And many vegetables as well.While fructose is a natural sugar found in plants, high-fructose corn syrup is processed in factories by extracting and mixing fructose and glucose from corn. There are different versions, but on average the high-fructose corn syrup in the food supply is about 55 percent fructose, 45 percent glucose. Sucrose, or table sugar, is 50:50. But while there are differences in how they are metabolized, high-fructose corn syrup and table sugar are more alike than they are different in their effects on health.The usual: a bit of legitimate science, a lot of hype and distortion. Some particular harms have been associated with fructose relative to glucose — notably, the production and accumulation of lipids in the liver, leading to the condition known as fatty liver. This, combined with the quantity of high-fructose corn syrup in the food supply, led to a backlash against it. That, in turn, got distorted into the idea that all fructose was bad, and that all foods containing fructose were bad, and the next thing we knew, people were renouncing fruit!The truth about fructose is a lot like the truth about every other nutrient: It’s the food that matters. Fructose on its own is generally found in fruits and vegetables, and those, of course, are almost invariably good for us; they defend against obesity, diabetes, and fatty liver.High-fructose corn syrup doesn’t occur in any natural food, so it is always a marker of a highly processed food. That food is apt to be bad for you for any number of reasons, the high sugar (fructose) content among them. The same is true of any added sugar, like sucrose, in a processed food: A load of added sugar is going to be bad, and may well be accompanied by other liabilities. But whole fruit is good for us, and the fructose in it does not change that. We don’t extract nutrients from food and live on those; we eat food and then the body processes all the nutrients in them. Eating fruit is not eating fructose; it’s eating fruit.The person most famously associated with chronicling the particular dangers of fructose, endocrinologist Dr. Robert Lustig, never recommended that people give up whole fruit. His particular concern was high exposure to fructose from added sugar, both high-fructose corn syrup and “regular” sugar.Well, they’re intended to take sugar out of your diet, take calories out of your diet, and not stimulate an insulin response, therefore — in theory — reducing the risk of weight gain, obesity, and diabetes.It’s not entirely clear. One of the biggest concerns about sugar substitutes is that they do nothing to file down a sweet tooth. If anything, they feed it and help grow it into a sweet “fang.” Because although they may satisfy the craving for sweet, artificial sweeteners are intensely sweet: They range in sweetness intensity from 600 to 1,300 times as sweet as sugar. So even as they satisfy a craving, it might be that they’re cultivating sweetness cravings.The best thing to do would be to not drink any soda, and, for that matter, to not add any sweetener — whether sugar or artificial sweetener — to your coffee or tea.For now it does, but you can retrain your palate. Rather than focusing on how artificial sweeteners are lower in sugar and calories, you might focus on changing your taste buds’ sensitivity for sweetness.Yup. Artificial sweeteners don’t help with that. We think of artificial sweetener like a Band-Aid. Of course, if you’re bleeding from a cut, a Band-Aid may help. So, we don’t rule it out as valuable. But it’s a temporary solution. For that cut, the long-term solution is for it to heal. For sugar intake, the long-term solution is to “heal” your diet so it’s not loaded up with sugar and other sweeteners. That way, you won’t be eating much sugar and you won’t need to rely on artificial sweeteners to replace what you are already avoiding.The direct concern is that these artificial sweeteners are exactly that: artificial. They are foreign chemicals that aren’t native nutrient components of food. Studies in animals have shown that artificial sweeteners can disrupt the microbiome.Your microbiome is the collection of bacteria that live in your GI tract. With artificial sweeteners, you put a chemical in your food and the bacteria say, “Hey, we don’t recognize this.” They get upset.That’s the particularly vexing part. The disruptions of the microbiome that result from artificial sweeteners have been shown in several studies to be directly related to the development of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a precursor to diabetes, one of the things that avoiding sugar helps us prevent. So, it’s ironic that chemical substitutes for sugar may contribute to the very problem they are intended to help us dodge. To be fair, the literature is still murky. There are some studies that show that sugar substitute-sweetened beverages and foods do help people reduce sugar and calories in the short term, so there may be some advantage. But longer-term studies show the sugar and calories cut out from one place sneak back in someplace else. And that the sweeteners themselves can do harm in other ways. So, there’s reason to be cautious, and to minimize your reliance on sugar substitutes.In fact, yes.If you eat a diet with minimal additions of sugar, you can satisfy your cravings for sweetness with a lot less of the stuff.Because you become a lot more sensitive to it. The more sugar and sweetness you eat, the more it takes to feel satisfied. The less you eat routinely, the less it takes.Yeah, sugar has been compared to any other addiction: The more you feed your craving for it, the more it needs. It’s called tolerance.It depends on how one chooses to define “addiction” — those views vary — but for all intents and purposes, yes, because one of the characteristic traits of addiction is tolerance. The more you get, the more you need. You may satisfy your craving for sugar in the moment, but you cultivate the craving over time.Like we said, taste bud rehab. Learn about all the places sugar is hiding in your diet where you don’t want it in the first place — like marinara sauce and salad dressing — and pick versions of those that don’t have all that added sugar (or make them yourself). Bottled tomato sauce may have more added sugar (relative to calories) than bottled chocolate ice cream topping.A lot of people, because they don’t know the sugar is there — but they like the way it tastes. Ditto for salad dressing, breads, pretzels, chips, and of course breakfast cereal — where sugar is, at times, the main ingredient. It’s safe to say that there’s added sugar in almost every highly processed food. Manufacturers know that because we have that sweet fang, these things appeal to us. You might be eating a variety of processed foods to get the sugar you crave even if you’re using an artificial sweetener in your coffee. Either cook, or look at the ingredient list on products. If there’s added sugar in there, pick something else.As long as sugar occupies a small place in your diet, we would recommend the real thing; a Coke a week isn’t going to kill you. But think of our mantra, “Instead of what?” You’re really better off with a peach and a glass of water.“Natural” sugar substitutes, like stevia or monk fruit extract, aren’t as intensely sweet as older artificial sweeteners. And in comparison to Splenda (for example), stevia is better because it isn’t a totally foreign chemical that disrupts the microbiome. (It’s even been shown to have an insulin-stabilizing effect.) And since eating less sugar is beneficial, these natural sugar replacements are promising. But the research isn’t conclusive.It’s a quantity problem, really. The more you push sugar to the margins of your diet, the better. Focus on the usual: vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains, lentils; beans, and fruit. You don’t need any of the sugar that’s in processed foods. Then, if you have an occasional soda or ice cream as a treat, that’s fine, because it no longer matters very much — you’ve already solved the bulk of the problem.Generally, the recommendation is that at most 10 percent of calories can come from added sugar. But 5 percent, or about five teaspoons a day, would be better. If you’re thinking in terms of 2,000 calories per day, that’s a small soda, or a teaspoon of sugar in each of five cups of coffee, or some ice cream, or sweetened yogurt . . . We’re not saying “don’t eat sugar.” We’re saying “don’t eat a lot of sugar.”Written by"
73,10 Things I Wish Someone Had Told Me About Freelancing,"Several times in recent years, a former journalism instructor has asked me to come talk to his class. I’ve always somewhat awkwardly postponed this, mostly because for a long time, I wasn’t sure I had much to say about freelancing or journalism or writing or anything else that would be remotely helpful to anyone. I pictured a classroom full of eyes blankly staring, fingers tapping and swiping for something more interesting than me trying to sound like I knew what I was talking about.I wasn’t sure I was really the freelance model of success my former instructor seemed to think I was. Did he want me to tell his students I’d been chasing a $350 invoice for a newspaper story for months? That all the hours I’d put into reporting, writing and editing that story worked out to about what I used to make foaming lattes at Peet’s? How I was pretty sure that “freelancing” was Latin for “never-ending tsunami of rejection”? (Actually, we’re apparently named after medieval mercenaries. Bet their invoices got paid faster, though.)But it occurred to me recently that after eight years of freelancing, about five of which it’s been how I eat and grudgingly pay the Comcast bill, I might have actually learned some things. So I started thinking about what I wish someone had told me back when I was a 23-year-old naively setting off down the freelance path.Here’s what I came up with.1. You won’t make any money off your own words. Yes, there are exceptions. I recently ruined my morning by reading a New York Times story about a 30-year-old waitress who landed a six-figure book deal. And occasionally you can find an organization with both the budget and the moral compass to pay a reasonable sum for your carefully crafted 3,000-word essay on the various uses for yak meat. But for the most part, freelance rates are kind of like Anna Wintour’s haircut or my love of stretchy pants—they haven’t changed since the ‘80s. (Actually, it might be worse than that. In 2002, the National Writer’s Union found that in real dollars, freelance rates had declined by more than 50% since the 1960s.)It took me a few years to accept that it’s nearly impossible to make a living off of writing alone. Sure, there are the assignments here and there that make you think, “Yeah, this could totally work.” But then that assignment ends, and you’re back to explaining to an alt weekly why no, you will not write them a blog post for $40.My solution to this is to simply spend more of my time working with other people’s words, charging an hourly rate for things like editing, research, and fact checking. (Clients are generally willing to pay a decent hourly rate for these services while writing is almost always a flat or per-word rate.) I try to make time for my own writing and reporting, but honestly it tends to take a backseat to the stuff that pays the bills.2. That doesn’t mean you should give up and start handing your words out for free to anyone who asks. See my rant on that issue here.3. You’ll spend a lot of time on things other than words. Freelancing is running your own business. By yourself. And yes, you can wear pajamas in your kitchen while you do it, but running your own business is still a hell of a lot of work. Be prepared to spend hours invoicing (and re-invoicing), reading and negotiating contracts, keeping track of expenses for taxes, and performing other housekeeping chores.Also, learn how to read a contract so you know what you’re signing. They’re usually not that complicated, but you want to know enough to decide whether to ask that the indemnification clause be removed or a kill fee added in. And get this settled BEFORE you start the work—you’d be surprised how many clients will send you a contract you didn’t know existed after you’ve already started a project. And that’s not a great time to be negotiating terms.4. The rejection will never stop, and you don’t want it to. Failure may be trendy these days, but I’ve been good at it for years. Seriously, I could wallpaper my apartment with all of the “Thanks, but I’ll pass” emails. This was really hard for me at first. When you’re just starting, it’s hard not to interpret each rejection as someone saying you’re not good enough to be doing this. It took probably three or four years before my brain learned to channel rejection as motivation.Other than letting the rejection pummel you for a few years until you don’t feel the blows anymore, here’s my advice:Don’t slink away after the first “no.” More than once, I’ve had a client express zero interest in my first pitch only to immediately accept a second idea. Hell, I’ve pitched myself as an editor or researcher to the same client for a couple of years before getting a contract.Pitch stuff even when you’re almost certain it’s going to be a no. I’ve had editors surprise me a few times by accepting pieces I was sure they would hate. Maybe I didn’t know them as well as I thought I did. Or maybe they just had a really good burrito for lunch that day and felt like saying yes to something.If the rejection ever does stop, either you’re the most successful freelancer ever or you’re not really putting yourself out there anymore.5. Used to the rejection yet? Good. Now you can deal with the criticism! As pretty much anyone who has ever put words on the internet knows, criticism is impossible to avoid. Whether you’re writing about the local community college or street clashes in Cairo or your own family, there will be people out there seething with rage as they scroll.So, all of those voices that are keeping you from hitting publish, all of those nasty things you’re afraid people will say? Oh, they’re going to say those things. They’re going to call you and say those things, email you, post on Facebook, probably discuss your lack of talent over brunch this weekend. The sooner you’re OK with that, the better.For me, the tricky part of criticism is that it’s hard not to become numb to it, to block out some of the constructive stuff along with the bizarre and the downright nasty. I’m still not very good at this to be honest, and I don’t know many writers who are.6. Fake it till you make it. There is no room for modesty in freelancing. You need to be able to pitch yourself as the greatest thing since cold-brewed coffee, whether you believe it or not at that particular moment. As a recovering perfectionist, it took me a while to break free of my irrational fear that someone somewhere would be thinking, “Who the hell does she think she is? She’s way out of her league here…” It’s true that confidence comes with experience—just don’t sell yourself short in the meantime. Pitch publications that you think are out of your reach, go after stories that seem too big, ask for more money when you think you deserve it, just keep aiming high until you believe that’s where you deserve to be.7. Take breaks. When you work from kitchen, it’s easy to keep typing with one hand as you use the other to eat whatever you just found in your fridge for lunch. Work can bleed into the evenings and weekends until you start to see Sunday as that annoying day when your work cafe is overcrowded with all of these inexplicably happy people in workout gear.This is not good. One of the main perks of freelancing is the flexible schedule, and you should take advantage of it. I still have a pang of guilt when I go for a run at 2 p.m. or make a trip to the grocery store on a Tuesday morning. There’s a voice in my head that says I should be working every second of every day. But you know what? That voice is stupid. I know I’m more productive when I take breaks, that my brain actually does better work more quickly when I make time for yoga classes and laptop-free lunches.8. Find a mentor. I don’t know how anyone survives without a mentor. By mentor, I mean someone in your field who sees your success as an extension of his or her own and does everything possible to propel you forward. Someone who inexplicably has your back in any situation and is always willing to take a break from his or her own stuff to deal with your stuff. This person is equal parts life coach, cheerleader, editor, colleague, and friend.How do you find these amazing people? Well, it might feel a little awkward, but you have to start by asking. Shoot your potential mentor an email asking if you can buy him or her coffee. When this person offers advice or work opportunities, pursue those opportunities with everything you’ve got. Show mentors that you’re invested, and they’ll invest in you, too. And then remember to pay it forward someday.9. Don’t put all your freelance eggs in one basket. Clients can vanish at any point, so don’t rely too heavily on any one in particular. Budgets get slashed, news organizations shut down, stories fade away, that one editor who really liked you moves on—if anything is certain in freelancing, it’s that everything ends at some point.Just the other day, an editing contract I was hoping to renew ended due to budget constraints. Though I’m disappointed because I liked the client and the gig, I also have others to help fill in that gap in my paycheck. And I’m always looking for more in case those go away, too.10. This might not be how you live forever. That’s OK. It takes just the right blend of work ethic and insanity to make freelancing work. This isn’t a lifestyle for everyone. If you find yourself feeling stressed out all the time or really wishing you had coworkers, it might be time to send out some resumes. I’ve spent essentially my entire adult life as a freelancer, and I’ve had some amazing experiences that I wouldn’t trade in for all the office gossip and 401Ks in the world. I love the flexibility of working from anywhere, being able to hop on a plane to go visit friends or family anytime I want. Freelancing and I were made for each other. But even I can’t promise you that we’ll be together forever. Or even five years from now.Right now, though, I’m going to sit here at my kitchen table in yoga pants, drink my tea, send another email chasing an invoice, type some more words, and then maybe make it to the grocery store before the rest of the city gets off work.Written by"
74,Coronavirus: Why You Must Act Now,"Anyone can publish on Medium per our Policies, but we don’t fact-check every story. For more info about the coronavirus, see cdc.gov.Updated on 3/19/2020. This article has received over 40 million views in the last week. Over 30 translations at the bottom. The next article is ready: Coronavirus, The Hammer and the Dance. If you agree with this article or the next, sign the White House petition. Here’s a list of epidemiologists and experts who have publicly shared or endorsed this article.With everything that’s happening about the Coronavirus, it might be very hard to make a decision of what to do today. Should you wait for more information? Do something today? What?Here’s what I’m going to cover in this article, with lots of charts, data and models with plenty of sources:When you’re done reading the article, this is what you’ll take away:The coronavirus is coming to you. It’s coming at an exponential speed: gradually, and then suddenly.It’s a matter of days. Maybe a week or two.When it does, your healthcare system will be overwhelmed.Your fellow citizens will be treated in the hallways. Exhausted healthcare workers will break down. Some will die.They will have to decide which patient gets the oxygen and which one dies. The only way to prevent this is social distancing today. Not tomorrow. Today.That means keeping as many people home as possible, starting now.As a politician, community leader or business leader, you have the power and the responsibility to prevent this.You might have fears today: What if I overreact? Will people laugh at me? Will they be angry at me? Will I look stupid? Won’t it be better to wait for others to take steps first? Will I hurt the economy too much?But in 2–4 weeks, when the entire world is in lockdown, when the few precious days of social distancing you will have enabled will have saved lives, people won’t criticize you anymore: They will thank you for making the right decision.Ok, let’s do this.The total number of cases grew exponentially until China contained it. But then, it leaked outside, and now it’s a pandemic that nobody can stop.As of today, this is mostly due to Italy, Iran and South Korea:There are so many cases in South Korea, Italy and Iran that it’s hard to see the rest of the countries, but let’s zoom in on that corner at the bottom right.There are dozens of countries with exponential growth rates. As of today, most of them are Western.If you keep up with that type of growth rate for just a week, this is what you get:If you want to understand what will happen, or how to prevent it, you need to look at the cases that have already gone through this: China, Eastern countries with SARS experience, and Italy.This is one of the most important charts.It shows in orange bars the daily official number of cases in the Hubei province: How many people were diagnosed that day.The grey bars show the true daily coronavirus cases. The Chinese CDC found these by asking patients during the diagnostic when their symptoms started.Crucially, these true cases weren’t known at the time. We can only figure them out looking backwards: The authorities don’t know that somebody just started having symptoms. They know when somebody goes to the doctor and gets diagnosed.What this means is that the orange bars show you what authorities knew, and the grey ones what was really happening.On January 21st, the number of new diagnosed cases (orange) is exploding: there are around 100 new cases. In reality, there were 1,500 new cases that day, growing exponentially. But the authorities didn’t know that. What they knew was that suddenly there were 100 new cases of this new illness.Two days later, authorities shut down Wuhan. At that point, the number of diagnosed daily new cases was ~400. Note that number: they made a decision to close the city with just 400 new cases in a day. In reality, there were 2,500 new cases that day, but they didn’t know that.The day after, another 15 cities in Hubei shut down.Up until Jan 23rd, when Wuhan closes, you can look at the grey graph: it’s growing exponentially. True cases were exploding. As soon as Wuhan shuts down, cases slow down. On Jan 24th, when another 15 cities shut down, the number of true cases (again, grey) grinds to a halt. Two days later, the maximum number of true cases was reached, and it has gone down ever since.Note that the orange (official) cases were still growing exponentially: For 12 more days, it looked like this thing was still exploding. But it wasn’t. It’s just that the cases were getting stronger symptoms and going to the doctor more, and the system to identify them was stronger.This concept of official and true cases is important. Let’s keep it in mind for later.The rest of regions in China were well coordinated by the central government, so they took immediate and drastic measures. This is the result:Every flat line is a Chinese region with coronavirus cases. Each one had the potential to become exponential, but thanks to the measures happening just at the end of January, all of them stopped the virus before it could spread.Meanwhile, South Korea, Italy and Iran had a full month to learn, but didn’t. They started the same exponential growth of Hubei and passed every other Chinese region before the end of February.South Korea cases have exploded, but have you wondered why Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand or Hong Kong haven’t?All of them were hit by SARS in 2003, and all of them learned from it. They learned how viral and lethal it could be, so they knew to take it seriously. That’s why all of their graphs, despite starting to grow much earlier, still don’t look like exponentials.So far, we have stories of coronavirus exploding, governments realizing the threat, and containing them. For the rest of the countries, however, it’s a completely different story.Before I jump to them, a note about South Korea: The country is probably an outlier. The coronavirus was contained for the first 30 cases. Patient 31 was a super-spreader who passed it to thousands of other people. Because the virus spreads before people show symptoms, by the time the authorities realized the issue, the virus was out there. They’re now paying the consequences of that one instance. Their containment efforts show, however: Italy has already passed it in numbers of cases, and Iran will pass it tomorrow (3/10/2020).You’ve already seen the growth in Western countries, and how bad forecasts of just one week look like. Now imagine that containment doesn’t happen like in Wuhan or in other Eastern countries, and you get a colossal epidemic.Let’s look at a few cases, such as Washington State, the San Francisco Bay Area, Paris and Madrid.Washington State is the US’s Wuhan.The number of cases there is growing exponentially. It’s currently at 140.But something interesting happened early on. The death rate was through the roof. At some point, the state had 3 cases and one death.We know from other places that the death rate of the coronavirus is anything between 0.5% and 5% (more on that later). How could the death rate be 33%?It turned out that the virus had been spreading undetected for weeks. It’s not like there were only 3 cases. It’s that authorities only knew about 3, and one of them was dead because the more serious the condition, the more likely somebody is to be tested.This is a bit like the orange and grey bars in China: Here they only knew about the orange bars (official cases) and they looked good: just 3. But in reality, there were hundreds, maybe thousands of true cases.This is an issue: You only know the official cases, not the true ones. But you need to know the true ones. How can you estimate the true ones? It turns out, there’s a couple of ways. And I have a model for both, so you can play with the numbers too (direct link to copy of the model).First, through deaths. If you have deaths in your region, you can use that to guess the number of true current cases. We know approximately how long it takes for that person to go from catching the virus to dying on average (17.3 days). That means the person who died on 2/29 in Washington State probably got infected around 2/12.Then, you know the mortality rate. For this scenario, I’m using 1% (we’ll discuss later the details). That means that, around 2/12, there were already around ~100 cases in the area (of which only one ended up in death 17.3 days later).Now, use the average doubling time for the coronavirus (time it takes to double cases, on average). It’s 6.2. That means that, in the 17 days it took this person to die, the cases had to multiply by ~8 (=2^(17/6)). That means that, if you are not diagnosing all cases, one death today means 800 true cases today.Washington state has today 22 deaths. With that quick calculation, you get ~16,000 true coronavirus cases today. As many as the official cases in Italy and Iran combined.If we look into the detail, we realize that 19 of these deaths were from one cluster, which might not have spread the virus widely. So if we consider those 19 deaths as one, the total deaths in the state is four. Updating the model with that number, we still get ~3,000 cases today.This approach from Trevor Bedford looks at the viruses themselves and their mutations to assess the current case count.The conclusion is that there are likely ~1,100 cases in Washington state right now.None of these approaches are perfect, but they all point to the same message: We don’t know the number of true cases, but it’s much higher than the official one. It’s not in the hundreds. It’s in the thousands, maybe more.San Francisco Bay AreaUntil 3/8, the Bay Area didn’t have any death. That made it hard to know how many true cases there were. Officially, there were 86 cases. But the US is vastly undertesting because it doesn’t have enough kits. The country decided to create their own test kit, which turned out not to work.These were the number of tests carried out in different countries by March 3rd:Turkey, with no cases of coronavirus, had 10 times the testing per inhabitant than the US. The situation is not much better today, with ~8,000 tests performed in the US, which means ~4,000 people have been tested.Here, you can just use a share of official cases to true cases. How to decide which one? For the Bay Area, they were testing everybody who had traveled or was in contact with a traveler, which means that they knew most of the travel-related cases, but none of the community spread cases. By having a sense of community spread vs. travel spread, you can know how many true cases there are.I looked at that ratio for South Korea, which has great data. By the time they had 86 cases, the % of them from community spread was 86% (86 and 86% are a coincidence).With that number, you can calculate the number of true cases. If the Bay Area has 86 cases today, it is likely that the true number is ~600.France claims 1,400 cases today and 30 deaths. Using the two methods above, you can have a range of cases: between 24,000 and 140,000.The true number of coronavirus cases in France today is likely to be between 24,000 and 140,000.Let me repeat that: the number of true cases in France is likely to be between one and two orders or magnitude higher than it is officially reported.Don’t believe me? Let’s look at the Wuhan graph again.If you stack up the orange bars until 1/22, you get 444 cases. Now add up all the grey bars. They add up to ~12,000 cases. So when Wuhan thought it had 444 cases, it had 27 times more. If France thinks it has 1,400 cases, it might well have tens of thousandsThe same math applies to Paris. With ~30 cases inside the city, the true number of cases is likely to be in the hundreds, maybe thousands. With 300 cases in the Ile-de-France region, the total cases in the region might already exceed tens of thousands.Spain has very similar numbers as France (1,200 cases vs. 1,400, and both have 30 deaths). That means the same rules are valid: Spain has probably upwards of 20k true cases already.In the Comunidad de Madrid region, with 600 official cases and 17 deaths, the true number of cases is likely between 10,000 and 60,000.If you read these data and tell yourself: “Impossible, this can’t be true”, just think this: With this number of cases, Wuhan was already in lockdown.With the number of cases we see today in countries like the US, Spain, France, Iran, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden or Switzerland, Wuhan was already in lockdown.And if you’re telling yourself: “Well, Hubei is just one region”, let me remind you that it has nearly 60 million people, bigger than Spain and about the size of France.So the coronavirus is already here. It’s hidden, and it’s growing exponentially.What will happen in our countries when it hits? It’s easy to know, because we already have several places where it’s happening. The best examples are Hubei and Italy.The World Health Organization (WHO) quotes 3.4% as the fatality rate (% people who contract the coronavirus and then die). This number is out of context so let me explain it.It really depends on the country and the moment: between 0.6% in South Korea and 4.4% in Iran. So what is it? We can use a trick to figure it out.The two ways you can calculate the fatality rate is Deaths/Total Cases and Death/Closed Cases. The first one is likely to be an underestimate, because lots of open cases can still end up in death. The second is an overestimate, because it’s likely that deaths are closed quicker than recoveries.What I did was look at how both evolve over time. Both of these numbers will converge to the same result once all cases are closed, so if you project past trends to the future, you can make a guess on what the final fatality rate will be.This is what you see in the data. China’s fatality rate is now between 3.6% and 6.1%. If you project that in the future, it looks like it converges towards ~3.8%-4%. This is double the current estimate, and 30 times worse than the flu.It is made up of two completely different realities though: Hubei and the rest of China.Hubei’s fatality rate will probably converge towards 4.8%. Meanwhile, for the rest of China, it will likely converge to ~0.9%:I also charted the numbers for Iran, Italy and South Korea, the only countries with enough deaths to make this somewhat relevant.Iran’s and Italy’s Deaths / Total Cases are both converging towards the 3%-4% range. My guess is their numbers will end up around that figure too.South Korea is the most interesting example, because these 2 numbers are completely disconnected: deaths / total cases is only 0.6%, but deaths / closed cases is a whopping 48%. My take on it is that a few unique things are happening there. First, they’re testing everybody (with so many open cases, the death rate seems low), and leaving the cases open for longer (so they close cases quickly when the patient is dead). Second, they have a lot of hospital beds (see chart 17.b). There might also be other reasons we don’t know. What is relevant is that deaths/cases has hovered around 0.5% since the beginning, suggesting it will stay there, likely heavily influenced by the healthcare system and crisis management.The last relevant example is the Diamond Princess cruise: with 706 cases, 6 deaths and 100 recoveries, the fatality rate will be between 1% and 6.5%.Note that the age distribution in each country will also have an impact: Since mortality is much higher for older people, countries with an aging population like Japan will be harder hit on average than younger countries like Nigeria. There are also weather factors, especially humidity and temperature, but it’s still unclear how this will impact transmission and fatality rates.This is what you can conclude:Put in another way: Countries that act fast can reduce the number of deaths by a factor of ten. And that’s just counting the fatality rate. Acting fast also drastically reduces the cases, making this even more of a no-brainer.Countries that act fast reduce the number of deaths at least by 10x.So what does a country need to be prepared?Around 20% of cases require hospitalization, 5% of cases require the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and around 2.5% require very intensive help, with items such as ventilators or ECMO (extra-corporeal oxygenation).The problem is that items such as ventilators and ECMO can’t be produced or bought easily. A few years ago, the US had a total of 250 ECMO machines, for example.So if you suddenly have 100,000 people infected, many of them will want to go get tested. Around 20,000 will require hospitalization, 5,000 will need the ICU, and 1,000 will need machines that we don’t have enough of today. And that’s just with 100,000 cases.That is without taking into account issues such as masks. A country like the US has only 1% of the masks it needs to cover the needs of its healthcare workers (12M N95, 30M surgical vs. 3.5B needed). If a lot of cases appear at once, there will be masks for only 2 weeks.Countries like Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong or Singapore, as well as Chinese regions outside of Hubei, have been prepared and given the care that patients need.But the rest of Western countries are rather going in the direction of Hubei and Italy. So what is happening there?The stories that happened in Hubei and those in Italy are starting to become eerily similar. Hubei built two hospitals in ten days, but even then, it was completely overwhelmed.Both complained that patients inundated their hospitals. They had to be taken care of anywhere: in hallways, in waiting rooms…Healthcare workers spend hours in a single piece of protective gear, because there’s not enough of them. As a result, they can’t leave the infected areas for hours. When they do, they crumble, dehydrated and exhausted. Shifts don’t exist anymore. People are driven back from retirement to cover needs. People who have no idea about nursing are trained overnight to fulfill critical roles. Everybody is on call, always.That is, until they become sick. Which happens a lot, because they’re in constant exposure to the virus, without enough protective gear. When that happens, they need to be in quarantine for 14 days, during which they can’t help. Best case scenario, 2 weeks are lost. Worst case, they’re dead.The worst is in the ICUs, when patients need to share ventilators or ECMOs. These are in fact impossible to share, so the healthcare workers must determine what patient will use it. That really means, which one lives and which one dies.“After a few days, we have to choose. […] Not everyone can be intubated. We decide based on age and state of health.” —Christian Salaroli, Italian MD.All of this is what drives a system to have a fatality rate of ~4% instead of ~0.5%. If you want your city or your country to be part of the 4%, don’t do anything today.This is a pandemic now. It can’t be eliminated. But what we can do is reduce its impact.Some countries have been exemplary at this. The best one is Taiwan, which is extremely connected with China and yet still has as of today fewer than 50 cases. This recent paper explain all the measures they took early on, which were focused on containment.They have been able to contain it, but most countries lacked this expertise and didn’t. Now, they’re playing a different game: mitigation. They need to make this virus as inoffensive as possible.If we reduce the infections as much as possible, our healthcare system will be able to handle cases much better, driving the fatality rate down. And, if we spread this over time, we will reach a point where the rest of society can be vaccinated, eliminating the risk altogether. So our goal is not to eliminate coronavirus contagions. It’s to postpone them.The more we postpone cases, the better the healthcare system can function, the lower the mortality rate, and the higher the share of the population that will be vaccinated before it gets infected.How do we flatten the curve?There is one very simple thing that we can do and that works: social distancing.If you go back to the Wuhan graph, you will remember that as soon as there was a lockdown, cases went down. That’s because people didn’t interact with each other, and the virus didn’t spread.The current scientific consensus is that this virus can be spread within 2 meters (6 feet) if somebody coughs. Otherwise, the droplets fall to the ground and don’t infect you.The worst infection then becomes through surfaces: The virus survives for up to 9 days on different surfaces such as metal, ceramics and plastics. That means things like doorknobs, tables, or elevator buttons can be terrible infection vectors.The only way to truly reduce that is with social distancing: Keeping people home as much as possible, for as long as possible until this recedes.This has already been proven in the past. Namely, in the 1918 flu pandemic.You can see how Philadelphia didn’t act quickly, and had a massive peak in death rates. Compare that with St Louis, which did.Then look at Denver, which enacted measures and then loosened them. They had a double peak, with the 2nd one higher than the first.If you generalize, this is what you find:This chart shows, for the 1918 flu in the US, how many more deaths there were per city depending on how fast measures were taken. For example, a city like St Louis took measures 6 days before Pittsburgh, and had less than half the deaths per citizen. On average, taking measures 20 days earlier halved the death rate.Italy has finally figured this out. They first locked down Lombardy on Sunday, and one day later, on Monday, they realized their mistake and decided they had to lock down the entire country.Hopefully, we will see results in the coming days. However, it will take one to two weeks to see. Remember the Wuhan graph: there was a delay of 12 days between the moment when the lockdown was announced and the moment when official cases (orange) started going down.The question politicians are asking themselves today is not whether they should do something, but rather what’s the appropriate action to take.There are several stages to control an epidemic, starting with anticipation and ending with eradication. But it’s too late for most options today. With this level of cases, the only options politicians have in front of them are containment, mitigation or suppression.ContainmentContainment is making sure all the cases are identified, controlled, and isolated. It’s what Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan or Taiwan are doing so well: They very quickly limit people coming in, identify the sick, immediately isolate them, use heavy protective gear to protect their health workers, track all their contacts, quarantine them… This works extremely well when you’re prepared and you do it early on, and don’t need to grind your economy to a halt to make it happen.I’ve already touted Taiwan’s approach. But China’s is good too. The lengths at which it went to contain the virus are mind-boggling. For example, they had up to 1,800 teams of 5 people each tracking every infected person, everybody they got interacted with, then everybody those people interacted with, and isolating the bunch. That’s how they were able to contain the virus across a billion-people country.This is not what Western countries have done. And now it’s too late. The recent US announcement that most travel from Europe was banned is a containment measure for a country that has, as of today, 3 times the cases that Hubei had when it shut down, growing exponentially. How can we know if it’s enough? It turns out, we can know by looking at the Wuhan travel ban.This chart shows the impact that the Wuhan travel ban had delaying the epidemic. The bubble sizes show the number of daily cases. The top line shows the cases if nothing is done. The two other lines show the impact if 40% and 90% of travel is eliminated. This is a model created by epidemiologists, because we can’t know for sure.If you don’t see much difference, you’re right. It’s very hard to see any change in the development of the epidemic.Researchers estimate that, all in all, the Wuhan travel ban only delayed the spread in China by 3–5 days.Now what did researchers think the impact of reducing transmission would be?The top bloc is the same as the one you’ve seen before. The two other blocks show decreasing transmission rates. If the transmission rate goes down by 25% (through Social Distancing), it flattens the curve and delays the peak by a whole 14 weeks. Lower the transition rate by 50%, and you can’t see the epidemic even starting within a quarter.The US administration’s ban on European travel is good: It has probably bought us a few hours, maybe a day or two. But not more. It is not enough. It’s containment when what’s needed is mitigation.Once there are hundreds or thousands of cases growing in the population, preventing more from coming, tracking the existing ones and isolating their contacts isn’t enough anymore. The next level is mitigation or suppression.Mitigation or SuppressionThe new article, Coronavirus: The Hammer and the Dance, covers mitigation vs. suppression at length.Mitigation requires a heavy amount of testing, contact tracing, quarantines and isolations to flatten the curve without stopping the outbreakSuppression tries to go one step further and quench the outbreak. It requires heavy social distancing. People need to stop hanging out to drop the transmission rate (R), from the R=~2–3 that the virus follows without measures, to below 1, so that it eventually dies out.These measures require closing companies, shops, mass transit, schools, enforcing lockdowns… The worse your situation, the worse the social distancing. The earlier you impose heavy measures, the less time you need to keep them, the easier it is to identify brewing cases, and the fewer people get infected.This is what Wuhan had to do. This is what Italy was forced to accept. And then France, Spain, and many other countries. Because when the virus is rampant, the only measure is to lock down all the infected areas to stop spreading it at once.With thousands of official cases — and tens of thousands of true ones — this is what countries like the US, the UK, Germany, Netherlands or Switzerland need to do.But they’re not doing it.Some business are working from home, which is fantastic.Some mass events are being stopped.Some affected areas are in quarantining themselves.All these measures will slow down the virus. They will lower the transmission rate from 2.5 to 2.2, maybe 2. Hopefully more. But they aren’t enough to get us below 1 for a sustained period of time to stop the epidemic.So the question becomes: What are the tradeoffs we could be making to lower the R? This is the menu that Italy has put in front of all of us:Then two days later, they added: No, in fact, you need to close all businesses that aren’t crucial. So now we’re closing all commercial activities, offices, cafes and shops. Only transportation, pharmacies, groceries will remain open.”How to pick the right measures for your country? Read Coronavirus: The Hammer and the Dance. One approach is to gradually increase measures. Unfortunately, that gives precious time for the virus to spread. If you want to be safe, do it Wuhan style. People might complain now, but they’ll thank you later.If you’re a business leader and you want to know what you should do, the best resource for you is Staying Home Club.It is a list of social distancing policies that have been enacted by US tech companies—so far, 328.They range from allowed to required Work From Home, and restricted visits, travel, or events.There are more things that every company must determine, such as what to do with hourly workers, whether to keep the office open or not, how to conduct interviews, what to do with the cafeterias… If you want to know how my company, Course Hero, handled some of these, along with a model announcement to your employees, here is the one my company used (view only version here).It is very possible that so far you’ve agreed with everything I’ve said, and were just wondering since the beginning when to make each decision. Put in another way, what triggers should we have for each measure.To solve this, I’ve created a model (direct link to copy).It enables you to assess the likely number of cases in your area, the probability that your employees are already infected, how that evolves over time, and how that should tell you whether to remain open.It tells us things like:The model uses labels such as “company” and “employee”, but the same model can be used for anything else: schools, mass transit… So if you have only 50 employees in Paris, but all of them are going to take the train, coming across thousands of other people, suddenly the likelihood that at least one of them will get infected is much higher and you should close your office immediately.If you’re still hesitating because nobody is showing symptoms, just realize 26% of contagions happen before there are symptoms.This math is selfish. It looks at every company’s risk individually, taking as much risk as we want until the inevitable hammer of the coronavirus closes our offices.But if you’re part of a league of business leaders or politicians, your calculations are not for just one company, but for the whole. The math becomes: What’s the likelihood that any of our companies is infected? If you’re a group of 50 companies of 250 employees on average, in the SF Bay Area, there’s a 35% chance that at least one of the companies has an employee infected, and 97% chance that will be true next week. I added a tab in the model to play with that.It might feel scary to make a decision today, but you shouldn’t think about it this way.This theoretical model shows different communities: one doesn’t take social distancing measures, one takes them on Day n of an outbreak, the other one on Day n+1. All the numbers are completely fictitious (I chose them to resemble what happened in Hubei, with ~6k daily new cases at the worst). They’re just there to illustrate how important a single day can be in something that grows exponentially. You can see that the one-day delay peaks later and higher, but then daily cases converge to zero.But what about cumulative cases?In this theoretical model that resembles loosely Hubei, waiting one more day creates 40% more cases! So, maybe, if the Hubei authorities had declared the lockdown on 1/22 instead of 1/23, they might have reduced the number of cases by a staggering 20k.And remember, these are just cases. Mortality would be much higher, because not only would there be directly 40% more deaths. There would also be a much higher collapse of the healthcare system, leading to a mortality rate up to 10x higher as we saw before. So a one-day difference in social distancing measures can end exploding the number of deaths in your community by multiplying more cases and higher fatality rate.This is an exponential threat. Every day counts. When you’re delaying by a single day a decision, you’re not contributing to a few cases maybe. There are probably hundreds or thousands of cases in your community already. Every day that there isn’t social distancing, these cases grow exponentially.This is probably the one time in the last decade that sharing an article might save lives.

75,Lessons I’ve Learned From Studying Money for 10 Years,"I started learning about money more than 10 years ago because I didn’t understand it and kept losing and trying to play catch up in the game of money. The process of learning about money started with reading the following books:Completing high school and studying sound engineering taught me nothing about money. My parents didn’t teach me good money habits either. I learned the hard way and it’s my goal to ensure you don’t have to (seek your own financial advice obviously). In 2011, my study of money led me to work in the finance industry.Here are the simple lessons I’ve learned from studying money for 10 years.Studying money has nothing to do with being rich and famous. As soon as I understood money, it became obvious it was all about psychology.Stock markets trade on sentiment. Humans buy assets and sell them too. You’ll be terrible with money if you don’t understand your own psychology. My psychology works best when I aim for the long term and take away most of the decision-making ability.I quickly realized when I began trading, that my short-term results were entirely driven by temptation and shiny object syndrome.Learn about psychology and you can master your mind when it comes to money and the right strategy for you.Money is pointless if it’s not put towards something good.The people who have the most money — like Warren Buffett and Bill Gates — give it all away and use it for good. They understand that leaving money to their family is a burden if they weren’t the ones who earnt it.Give your money away. Help those who are in dire situations. Objects bought with money don’t make you feel good: people do.It doesn’t matter how smart you are. You will make bad investment decisions.You’ll buy a company that turns to dust and had no signs of going south (like WeWork). You’ll get into high-risk investments when the returns are low, like Startups, and think you can spot winners. The philosophy of 500 Startups, an investment fund, is based on the idea that you can’t pick winners.The companies that should make money don’t. And the companies run by pot-smoking millennial’s who lied about their Harvard Education can go on to make millions. The facts, when it comes to investing, are easily distorted and unrelated to investment returns.You know nothing; therefore, you have a chance when you act on that idea.The media industry gives terrible financial advice. They chase headlines that lead to views, not information that will help you make money.If you’re an asshole before you have money, that won’t change when you have money. Money amplifies who you are. If you won’t give a dollar when you have fifty, you definitely won’t give a dollar when you have millions.Start early by giving a portion of your money away, therefore, telling your mind that you have enough and you are enough.This is a huge lesson: money can be printed out of thin air. Inflation can eat away at your savings. Look at the value of the USD over the last few decades on Google. You’ll be somewhat surprised.You protect against money devaluing by investing in assets that retain their value over time: gold, stocks, property.This one is a quote from Warren Buffett.Right now, everybody is being greedy and we’re at the end of a very long bull market. It’s nothing to be scared of. Don’t sell up everything. Just understand that investing money is based on cycles.If everything is going up and the value is not there, be slightly more fearful and adjust the way you invest accordingly. Here’s how it works in simple terms:When the market is going up like mad, sit in cash or liquid assets that can be easily sold if required.When the market goes down by 30% or 40% and fear is everywhere, it’s time to get a discount. You deserve it.When you have money there are two options: invest or save.Investing is putting your money to work. Put your money to work in the following ways:There are a lot of douche bags with money. Money can cause your ego to blow up and make you think everything you touch turns to gold. I was that dude in my 20s so that’s how I know. Watch your ego as you make money. Here’s how to audit your ego:Do you think too highly of yourself?Do you talk down to people because of your money?Is your confidence slightly too high?Do you preach or teach?Do you use money to buy material possessions that prove you have money?An out of control ego is the default outcome of having money. If you do nothing, your ego will get big and that won’t be good for you.How you treat others is how people treat you.You’ll feel better about life when you attract good people into your life, not repel them with your money and end up a lonely old man/woman.Money is a fantastic teacher. You learn the best lessons when you lose money like I did when $40,000 went up in smoke thanks to a car.You can make a million-dollars, but you can also lose it too. And faster than you think.I have been told my entire life that writers can’t make money from their art.When I joined the blogging world in 2014, everybody told me it was a noisy corner of the internet and the money I’d get from ads (the main source of income at the time) scattered through my writing wouldn’t even be enough to buy one latte a day. I didn’t listen and proved them wrong by making more than $300K from writing.I don’t tell you that to be a smart ass. I tell you because when you put your heart and soul into an art form and commit for long enough (five years is a good amount of time), you can do anything.The way you make money online doesn’t matter and it’s forever changing. When you release enough work online and commit for long enough, opportunities to make money will find their way to your inbox and surprise you. You can make money from your art.It sounds like a fantasy. It’s not.Set up systems and you can make money while you sleep. A business is a system; a blog is a system; a social media channel, like LinkedIn, is a system; an investment in the stock market is a system. Systems make you income and automate money creation.The ultimate lie, when it comes to money, is that you’ll one day have enough — you won’t.No amount of money is ever enough until you make one decision: you decide you are enough. When you are enough, your desire to have more money and endlessly work for money disappears.Money is a reflection of value and when you value yourself, your view about money changes. That’s the biggest lesson learning about money has taught me. Money is just an extension of yourself.Join my email list to stay in touch.Written by"

Well, you will be surprised, but there will be much more practical work to do than just reading. But how to make the practice easier? Learn theory well, and don’t go to Google for any little thing later. So my advice is as follows — learn all the basics, make notes, try to form a certain structure of everything and make a scheme for all of them. Have a certain “knowledge-picture” in your mind. Don’t postpone some concepts for a better future. It will be really hard at the beginning, by the way, our mind is hard in learning new information (remember that). But, with great effort, there will be great results. Good luck!That’s how I wanna end this post.

77,Natural Language Processing is Fun!,"This article is part of an on-going series on NLP: Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4. You can also read a reader-translated version of this article in 普通话.Giant update: I’ve written a new book based on these articles! It not only expands and updates all my articles, but it has tons of brand new content and lots of hands-on coding projects. Check it out now!Computers are great at working with structured data like spreadsheets and database tables. But us humans usually communicate in words, not in tables. That’s unfortunate for computers.A lot of information in the world is unstructured — raw text in English or another human language. How can we get a computer to understand unstructured text and extract data from it?Natural Language Processing, or NLP, is the sub-field of AI that is focused on enabling computers to understand and process human languages. Let’s check out how NLP works and learn how to write programs that can extract information out of raw text using Python!Note: If you don’t care how NLP works and just want to cut and paste some code, skip way down to the section called “Coding the NLP Pipeline in Python”.As long as computers have been around, programmers have been trying to write programs that understand languages like English. The reason is pretty obvious — humans have been writing things down for thousands of years and it would be really helpful if a computer could read and understand all that data.Computers can’t yet truly understand English in the way that humans do — but they can already do a lot! In certain limited areas, what you can do with NLP already seems like magic. You might be able to save a lot of time by applying NLP techniques to your own projects.And even better, the latest advances in NLP are easily accessible through open source Python libraries like spaCy, textacy, and neuralcoref. What you can do with just a few lines of python is amazing.The process of reading and understanding English is very complex — and that’s not even considering that English doesn’t follow logical and consistent rules. For example, what does this news headline mean?“Environmental regulators grill business owner over illegal coal fires.”Are the regulators questioning a business owner about burning coal illegally? Or are the regulators literally cooking the business owner? As you can see, parsing English with a computer is going to be complicated.Doing anything complicated in machine learning usually means building a pipeline. The idea is to break up your problem into very small pieces and then use machine learning to solve each smaller piece separately. Then by chaining together several machine learning models that feed into each other, you can do very complicated things.And that’s exactly the strategy we are going to use for NLP. We’ll break down the process of understanding English into small chunks and see how each one works.Let’s look at a piece of text from Wikipedia:London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it Londinium.(Source: Wikipedia article “London”)This paragraph contains several useful facts. It would be great if a computer could read this text and understand that London is a city, London is located in England, London was settled by Romans and so on. But to get there, we have to first teach our computer the most basic concepts of written language and then move up from there.The first step in the pipeline is to break the text apart into separate sentences. That gives us this:We can assume that each sentence in English is a separate thought or idea. It will be a lot easier to write a program to understand a single sentence than to understand a whole paragraph.Coding a Sentence Segmentation model can be as simple as splitting apart sentences whenever you see a punctuation mark. But modern NLP pipelines often use more complex techniques that work even when a document isn’t formatted cleanly.Now that we’ve split our document into sentences, we can process them one at a time. Let’s start with the first sentence from our document:“London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom.”The next step in our pipeline is to break this sentence into separate words or tokens. This is called tokenization. This is the result:“London”, “is”, “ the”, “capital”, “and”, “most”, “populous”, “city”, “of”, “England”, “and”, “the”, “United”, “Kingdom”, “.”Tokenization is easy to do in English. We’ll just split apart words whenever there’s a space between them. And we’ll also treat punctuation marks as separate tokens since punctuation also has meaning.Next, we’ll look at each token and try to guess its part of speech — whether it is a noun, a verb, an adjective and so on. Knowing the role of each word in the sentence will help us start to figure out what the sentence is talking about.We can do this by feeding each word (and some extra words around it for context) into a pre-trained part-of-speech classification model:The part-of-speech model was originally trained by feeding it millions of English sentences with each word’s part of speech already tagged and having it learn to replicate that behavior.Keep in mind that the model is completely based on statistics — it doesn’t actually understand what the words mean in the same way that humans do. It just knows how to guess a part of speech based on similar sentences and words it has seen before.After processing the whole sentence, we’ll have a result like this:With this information, we can already start to glean some very basic meaning. For example, we can see that the nouns in the sentence include “London” and “capital”, so the sentence is probably talking about London.In English (and most languages), words appear in different forms. Look at these two sentences:I had a pony.I had two ponies.Both sentences talk about the noun pony, but they are using different inflections. When working with text in a computer, it is helpful to know the base form of each word so that you know that both sentences are talking about the same concept. Otherwise the strings “pony” and “ponies” look like two totally different words to a computer.In NLP, we call finding this process lemmatization — figuring out the most basic form or lemma of each word in the sentence.The same thing applies to verbs. We can also lemmatize verbs by finding their root, unconjugated form. So “I had two ponies” becomes “I [have] two [pony].”Lemmatization is typically done by having a look-up table of the lemma forms of words based on their part of speech and possibly having some custom rules to handle words that you’ve never seen before.Here’s what our sentence looks like after lemmatization adds in the root form of our verb:The only change we made was turning “is” into “be”.Next, we want to consider the importance of a each word in the sentence. English has a lot of filler words that appear very frequently like “and”, “the”, and “a”. When doing statistics on text, these words introduce a lot of noise since they appear way more frequently than other words. Some NLP pipelines will flag them as stop words —that is, words that you might want to filter out before doing any statistical analysis.Here’s how our sentence looks with the stop words grayed out:Stop words are usually identified by just by checking a hardcoded list of known stop words. But there’s no standard list of stop words that is appropriate for all applications. The list of words to ignore can vary depending on your application.For example if you are building a rock band search engine, you want to make sure you don’t ignore the word “The”. Because not only does the word “The” appear in a lot of band names, there’s a famous 1980’s rock band called The The!The next step is to figure out how all the words in our sentence relate to each other. This is called dependency parsing.The goal is to build a tree that assigns a single parent word to each word in the sentence. The root of the tree will be the main verb in the sentence. Here’s what the beginning of the parse tree will look like for our sentence:But we can go one step further. In addition to identifying the parent word of each word, we can also predict the type of relationship that exists between those two words:This parse tree shows us that the subject of the sentence is the noun “London” and it has a “be” relationship with “capital”. We finally know something useful — London is a capital! And if we followed the complete parse tree for the sentence (beyond what is shown), we would even found out that London is the capital of the United Kingdom.Just like how we predicted parts of speech earlier using a machine learning model, dependency parsing also works by feeding words into a machine learning model and outputting a result. But parsing word dependencies is particularly complex task and would require an entire article to explain in any detail. If you are curious how it works, a great place to start reading is Matthew Honnibal’s excellent article “Parsing English in 500 Lines of Python”.But despite a note from the author in 2015 saying that this approach is now standard, it’s actually out of date and not even used by the author anymore. In 2016, Google released a new dependency parser called Parsey McParseface which outperformed previous benchmarks using a new deep learning approach which quickly spread throughout the industry. Then a year later, they released an even newer model called ParseySaurus which improved things further. In other words, parsing techniques are still an active area of research and constantly changing and improving.It’s also important to remember that many English sentences are ambiguous and just really hard to parse. In those cases, the model will make a guess based on what parsed version of the sentence seems most likely but it’s not perfect and sometimes the model will be embarrassingly wrong. But over time our NLP models will continue to get better at parsing text in a sensible way.Want to try out dependency parsing on your own sentence? There’s a great interactive demo from the spaCy team here.So far, we’ve treated every word in our sentence as a separate entity. But sometimes it makes more sense to group together the words that represent a single idea or thing. We can use the information from the dependency parse tree to automatically group together words that are all talking about the same thing.For example, instead of this:We can group the noun phrases to generate this:Whether or not we do this step depends on our end goal. But it’s often a quick and easy way to simplify the sentence if we don’t need extra detail about which words are adjectives and instead care more about extracting complete ideas.Now that we’ve done all that hard work, we can finally move beyond grade-school grammar and start actually extracting ideas.In our sentence, we have the following nouns:Some of these nouns present real things in the world. For example, “London”, “England” and “United Kingdom” represent physical places on a map. It would be nice to be able to detect that! With that information, we could automatically extract a list of real-world places mentioned in a document using NLP.The goal of Named Entity Recognition, or NER, is to detect and label these nouns with the real-world concepts that they represent. Here’s what our sentence looks like after running each token through our NER tagging model:But NER systems aren’t just doing a simple dictionary lookup. Instead, they are using the context of how a word appears in the sentence and a statistical model to guess which type of noun a word represents. A good NER system can tell the difference between “Brooklyn Decker” the person and the place “Brooklyn” using context clues.Here are just some of the kinds of objects that a typical NER system can tag:NER has tons of uses since it makes it so easy to grab structured data out of text. It’s one of the easiest ways to quickly get value out of an NLP pipeline.Want to try out Named Entity Recognition yourself? There’s another great interactive demo from spaCy here.At this point, we already have a useful representation of our sentence. We know the parts of speech for each word, how the words relate to each other and which words are talking about named entities.However, we still have one big problem. English is full of pronouns — words like he, she, and it. These are shortcuts that we use instead of writing out names over and over in each sentence. Humans can keep track of what these words represent based on context. But our NLP model doesn’t know what pronouns mean because it only examines one sentence at a time.Let’s look at the third sentence in our document:“It was founded by the Romans, who named it Londinium.”If we parse this with our NLP pipeline, we’ll know that “it” was founded by Romans. But it’s a lot more useful to know that “London” was founded by Romans.As a human reading this sentence, you can easily figure out that “it” means “London”. The goal of coreference resolution is to figure out this same mapping by tracking pronouns across sentences. We want to figure out all the words that are referring to the same entity.Here’s the result of running coreference resolution on our document for the word “London”:With coreference information combined with the parse tree and named entity information, we should be able to extract a lot of information out of this document!Coreference resolution is one of the most difficult steps in our pipeline to implement. It’s even more difficult than sentence parsing. Recent advances in deep learning have resulted in new approaches that are more accurate, but it isn’t perfect yet. If you want to learn more about how it works, start here.Want to play with co-reference resolution? Check out this great co-reference resolution demo from Hugging Face.Here’s an overview of our complete NLP pipeline:Whew, that’s a lot of steps!Note: Before we continue, it’s worth mentioning that these are the steps in a typical NLP pipeline, but you will skip steps or re-order steps depending on what you want to do and how your NLP library is implemented. For example, some libraries like spaCy do sentence segmentation much later in the pipeline using the results of the dependency parse.So how do we code this pipeline? Thanks to amazing python libraries like spaCy, it’s already done! The steps are all coded and ready for you to use.First, assuming you have Python 3 installed already, you can install spaCy like this:Then the code to run an NLP pipeline on a piece of text looks like this:If you run that, you’ll get a list of named entities and entity types detected in our document:You can look up what each of those entity codes means here.Notice that it makes a mistake on “Londinium” and thinks it is the name of a person instead of a place. This is probably because there was nothing in the training data set similar to that and it made a best guess. Named Entity Detection often requires a little bit of model fine tuning if you are parsing text that has unique or specialized terms like this.Let’s take the idea of detecting entities and twist it around to build a data scrubber. Let’s say you are trying to comply with the new GDPR privacy regulations and you’ve discovered that you have thousands of documents with personally identifiable information in them like people’s names. You’ve been given the task of removing any and all names from your documents.Going through thousands of documents and trying to redact all the names by hand could take years. But with NLP, it’s a breeze. Here’s a simple scrubber that removes all the names it detects:And if you run that, you’ll see that it works as expected:What you can do with spaCy right out of the box is pretty amazing. But you can also use the parsed output from spaCy as the input to more complex data extraction algorithms. There’s a python library called textacy that implements several common data extraction algorithms on top of spaCy. It’s a great starting point.One of the algorithms it implements is called Semi-structured Statement Extraction. We can use it to search the parse tree for simple statements where the subject is “London” and the verb is a form of “be”. That should help us find facts about London.Here’s how that looks in code:And here’s what it prints:Maybe that’s not too impressive. But if you run that same code on the entire London wikipedia article text instead of just three sentences, you’ll get this more impressive result:Now things are getting interesting! That’s a pretty impressive amount of information we’ve collected automatically.For extra credit, try installing the neuralcoref library and adding Coreference Resolution to your pipeline. That will get you a few more facts since it will catch sentences that talk about “it” instead of mentioning “London” directly.By looking through the spaCy docs and textacy docs, you’ll see lots of examples of the ways you can work with parsed text. What we’ve seen so far is just a tiny sample.Here’s another practical example: Imagine that you were building a website that let’s the user view information for every city in the world using the information we extracted in the last example.If you had a search feature on the website, it might be nice to autocomplete common search queries like Google does:But to do this, we need a list of possible completions to suggest to the user. We can use NLP to quickly generate this data.Here’s one way to extract frequently-mentioned noun chunks from a document:If you run that on the London Wikipedia article, you’ll get output like this:This is just a tiny taste of what you can do with NLP. In future posts, we’ll talk about other applications of NLP like Text Classification and how systems like Amazon Alexa parse questions.But until then, install spaCy and start playing around! Or if you aren’t a Python user and end up using a different NLP library, the ideas should all work roughly the same way.This article is part of an on-going series on NLP.

78,"WeWork’s 15,000 Employees Are in Purgatory","“If I’m going to get laid off, it will probably be next week,” a WeWork employee told me recently with the frankness of someone who has come to terms with a terminal diagnosis.In Slack, on WhatsApp, and in other group chats, he and his 15,000 colleagues are buzzing about the fallout from their daredevil employer, which, two months ago, looked to be their ticket to a better, richer life. Perhaps, finally, a downpayment on that Brooklyn brownstone, a second place in Miami, or a way to bootstrap their own startup.With a sense of surreal disbelief, they have watched as their ambitious, fast-growing company bungled its crucial initial public offering of stock; plummeted in value; flirted with insolvency; bought out controversial CEO Adam Neumann with a $1.7 billion exit package; and began laying off employees in numbers soon expected to exceed 4,000.Editor’s Note: After publication, WeWork announced the size of this round of layoffs: 2,400 employees, with a possible further reduction of 1,000 more, plus the transfer of 1,000 maintenance staff to outsourcing firms (as noted below).In an email to the staff sent November 18, WeWork’s chairman, Marcelo Claure, promised that the cuts were “necessary” in light of the company’s financial position. Unsurprisingly, Claure, who was installed by majority shareholder SoftBank to restore order while the company hunts for a new CEO, made sure to point out that the layoffs would “increase efficiency and also accountability.”Accountability is a theme haunting WeWorkers a lot these days.In addition to the collective anger directed at Neumann and his wife, Rebekah, who served as the company’s chief brand and impact officer, employees are stunned by the lack of accountability on the part of other senior leaders, including SoftBank, members of the board, and other top executives.“There were so many smart people at the company — one, did people just not tell [Adam] what he needed to hear, or two, did he just not listen? It’s probably a little bit of both.”In a letter to management signed by 300 current WeWork employees, a copy of which was first published by the New York Times on November 8, workers decried the “deception, exclusion and selfishness playing out at the company’s highest levels.”“It’s surprising that no one was responsible, apparently,” says one current WeWorker.For this article, we reached out to a dozen current and former employees. Many people were reluctant to talk for fear of jeopardizing severance or because they don’t want to bad-mouth a company they still have so much invested in, financially and otherwise. Several former workers alluded to nondisclosure agreements. For those who did speak to us, we agreed to let them speak anonymously.“So many things could have been done to prevent this,” observes a former employee who left over the summer, around the time several company executives resigned. “There were so many smart people at the company — one, did people just not tell [Adam] what he needed to hear, or two, did he just not listen? It’s probably a little bit of both.”Arriving at a definitive answer to those questions is likely impossible — but it is something the WeWork diaspora will spend years asking themselves and each other.There was no shortage of obvious, egregious offenses that helped lead to one of the most spectacular corporate meltdowns in recent memory. The company rented out Madison Square Garden and the Staples Center for annual meetings, then booked Macklemore, DRAM, and Gucci Mane to perform for employees. Neumann, who shuttled among WeWork properties in New York in a chauffeured white Maybach, personally trademarked the We name, then licensed it back to the company for $5.9 million (he later returned the money). The wave-pool subsidiary. The tequila shots. Smoking weed on the corporate jet. Neumann’s phenomenal barefoot stroll through Manhattan.But well before WeWork filed its S1 paperwork for its $47 billion pre-IPO valuation, employees admit there were more subtle red flags if you knew where to look. The $850 million deal at the end of 2017 to buy the Lord & Taylor building in midtown Manhattan struck some employees as a turning point. Unlike previous real estate deals where WeWork purchased a property, immediately increased the building’s occupancy, and then realized the gain in value, the purchase of the flagship department store grabbed headlines but offered very little upside. “The problem with that deal was that all the value was already baked into the purchase price,” says one person familiar with the transaction.The decision to ban reimbursements of meat, pork, or poultry through corporate expenses was another episode when workers recall feeling something was amiss. Though some employees found the pro-environmental stance to be visionary, internal critics of the policy raised concerns that were both practical (how do you tell a client what to order at a business lunch?) and philosophical (why is our employer telling us what to eat?). The situation was further inflamed by persistent rumors that Neumann was spotted tucking into a ribeye or lamb shank in public.New executives were advised by colleagues to maintain a little distance between themselves and Neumann because his fast-and-loose style had a way of upending strategic thinking. And sympathy for his support staff ran deep; his former chief of staff, who filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in October alleging pregnancy discrimination at the company, was described by a source as “the nicest woman in the world who had to put up with his shit all the time.”“Everyone respects him for his original insight into the market. But the first time I sat with him, I remember thinking to myself, if I ever make it big, I hope not to be like that guy,” says a former WeWorker. “He did not treat people like human beings.”One thing that bothers many employees, in light of the company’s meltdown, is the stigma of WeWork as either a party culture or a cult of personality stocked with credulous millennials who hung on Neumann’s every word. The company’s lavish, mandatory summer-camp boondoggle in the English countryside in 2018, attended by every employee from every market around the world, was not as beloved as the company’s PR machine suggested. While some employees certainly were dazzled by Neumann and enjoyed mingling (and boozing) with their overseas peers, plenty of others secretly thought the gathering was a distraction and a silly reason to take them away from their families for four full days.“Never having procedures put in place, it always felt like a fire drill; the whole entire feeling was reactive versus proactive.”“I actually think there are a lot of wild mischaracterizations about the people who work here, most of whom are super-smart, talented, dedicated people who show up every day and do their job,” says a current employee in a technology role.Adding to the sting is the fact that the experience of working at WeWork, at least for some departments, was often anything but a party. Over the past few years of hyper-growth and particularly in the run-up to the planned IPO, employees often found themselves scrambling to make good on overly ambitious deadlines or handshake deals that senior executives made without understanding the unreasonable expectations they were placing on staff.“I was working 24/7, and I was miserable,” says a former employee who left to work for another startup. “Never having procedures put in place, it always felt like a fire drill; the whole entire feeling was reactive versus proactive.”In the run-up to the IPO, a number of key executives departed one after another, including the chief brand officer, the head of real estate partnerships, and a half-dozen top people in HR. The frequent departures at so sensitive a time fostered a sense of barely controlled chaos and led to a concern that maybe nobody was fully in charge. One former employee told me a story he heard about an early employee who simply stopped showing up for work; though he kept collecting paychecks, it was still several years before his absence was discovered. Though I couldn’t corroborate it, it says something about the company’s culture that he found the story to be at least plausible.For most workers, the anticipated IPO payday seemed worth the many tradeoffs. Depending on an employee’s department and when they were hired, salaries could be underwhelming, but the promise of options made it all seem worth it. “I was super-underpaid, but they always held equity in front of your face,” says the former employee.This was the case across departments, but it was especially true for members of the facilities team — the front-desk attendants, cleaners, and building maintenance people who are widely seen by the organization’s rank-and-file as the backbone of the company. These workers were paid what amounted to minimum wage, but in return for their labor, they were granted stock options and promised a career ladder — hallmarks of white-collar knowledge rarely afforded to people in low-paying jobs.Now, these employees’ options are underwater, and their career prospects seem pretty bleak. WeWork announced that, effective December 9, some front-line staff would see their employment outsourced to a firm called JLL while cleaners will be outsourced to a firm called ABM Facilities. WeWork provided these staffers five days to sign paperwork acceding to the new arrangement. Failure to do so would be construed as a resignation.“The way that it was handled, it gave these workers absolutely no choice,” says Hope Pordy, an attorney at SpivakLipton LLP, who is advising members of the coalition who sent the letter to WeWork’s senior management.“Workers did not have the opportunity to receive severance benefits,” she says. “And the company’s actions likely jeopardized their eligibility for unemployment benefits. They were basically set up so that the only option they had was to accept these offers.”And now the great unwinding begins. Already, the Meetup and Flatiron School teams — who came to WeWork through acquisition back during the flush times — have been issued pink slips. Some employees of Meetup, the community-minded technology platform that helped 44 million people organize 330,000 different groups around the world before it was acquired by Neumann’s outfit for $200 million in 2017, have separately rallied to reconstitute the business in some fashion.Those famously moldy telephone booths aren’t going to clean themselves.For the remaining WeWork employees in departments like product, engineering, marketing, and architecture, the contrast between before and after Labor Day is stark. When an employee is not worrying about losing their job, they are trying to figure out how to actually perform their job daily within a radically different context. “Having it drag on for so long creates an enormous amount of stress,” says one employee.Projects are still being completed, but it is difficult to know if a new marketing initiative, feature spec, or code release is in vain while the company remains in a state of purgatory. Some have fielded job offers from opportunistic companies based in WeWork offices while others are busy politely declining suggestions that they offer individual WeWork members premium office space at fire-sale rates.Human resources, which had been tasked with filling scores of jobs for most of the past year, has suddenly been rerouted from recruiting to negotiating severance agreements and fielding benefits-terminations questions.Meanwhile, the front-line staff are working as hard as ever. Kitchen pantries need to be stocked, conference room squabbles need to be adjudicated, and those famously moldy telephone booths aren’t going to clean themselves.“They are telling us that nothing’s going to change, that everything is going to stay the same,” one woman told me, shrugging her shoulders before she went to see about a mess in a conference room.The leadership of the company remains an open question. On November 11, the Wall Street Journal reported that WeWork’s board had talked to charismatic T-Mobile CEO John Legere about overseeing a turnaround, a prospect that has raised some eyebrows within the beleaguered company. With chin-length brown hair, a T-shirt/blazer uniform, and over-the-top management antics, Legere — superficially at least — resembles Neumann in about 25 years.“There’s a feeling of ‘can’t we just get a traditional, by-the-books CEO who knows how to run things?’” says an employee in technology. (This past Monday, Legere announced plans to step down from his T-Mobile post in the spring but also said he never talked to WeWork about the job and doesn’t plan to take it.)Amid the updating of resumes and researching COBRA rules, WeWorkers are also spending a lot of time trying to figure out what this devastating ride all means.WeWorkers bristle at comparisons to other great corporate collapses in recent memory — Theranos and Enron — because they see those businesses as out-and-out frauds. WeWork, they argue, was a solid business that built value. “The numbers didn’t lie — the company was doubling every single year,” says a former employee.In the end, WeWork’s lasting legacy may be that it changes the nature of work, just not in the way its founders originally imagined. The company’s collapse has prompted the mobilization of a large number of disgruntled workers — many of whom until very recently thought they were on the winning side of late-stage capitalism. Many of whom thought they’d become those overnight-minted millionaires.The employee coalition came together in late October when two different groups of WeWorkers were introduced by an eagle-eyed person outside of the company who noticed they both were trying to organize similar-looking campaigns on Kickstarter. The group quickly grew to 30 employees and then 300, and ultimately 750 people joined a company Slack channel. (The coalition eventually set up a new Slack channel outside of the corporate environment and began moving members over.)Already, its organizers have challenged what to expect from an embattled employer. For example, they have lobbied for the standard protections for laid-off workers including severance and health-continuation benefits with special help for employees with visas. They are also asking WeWork to abandon noncompete and nonsolicitation agreements and forced-arbitration clauses in contracts.But they have voiced more radical ideas as well, such as across-the-board employee compensation for the loss in value of their equity through accelerated vesting or some other modification of the current plan. While an individual worker will sometimes negotiate terms like this, it is fairly unusual for a group of workers to make such a claim. But as we see more collective bargaining activity in digital workplaces, where stock options are commonplace, we may see this happen more frequently.The solidarity between white-collar architects, engineers, and product managers and blue-collar maintenance workers and cleaners is a development worth noting, too—it seems like a phenomenon that could only have emerged from WeWork, that rare hybrid of a tech company that’s also a landlord.Intriguingly, the worker coalition also floated the idea of giving employees a greater say in corporate governance altogether. “Employees need a seat at the table so the company can address a broader range of issues,” the letter writers argued. “We’ve seen what can happen when leadership makes decisions while employees have no voice.” (This language hints at a proposal Sen. Elizabeth Warren has made on the presidential campaign trail to let employees elect some members of corporate boards.)So far, WeWork has acknowledged receipt of the coalition’s letter, and Claure emailed a noncommittal note to several of the most active members. But WeWork has not recognized the group officially or accepted its invitation to meet. As layoffs disperse thousands of WeWork employees, some if not all of these demands will likely be shelved.Still, WeWork’s workers soon to be released into the job market have been changed by this experience. “One of the things that has been remarkable to me about the group is the energy with which they have come together,” says Hope Pordy. “They are realizing what they can accomplish when they band together, share information, share resources — that’s been empowering to them.”WeWork extolled an ethos of community-mindedness, personal fulfillment, and corporate egalitarianism — a progressive vision for the company that most employees genuinely embraced. If they didn’t believe in the value of “togetherness” before, many of them certainly do now. But it’s togetherness redefined: They have observed corporate greed and every-man-for-himself behavior at close range, and they reject it. In their next jobs, they will be less likely to quietly toe the party line and more likely to question who they are working for.“When they were recruiting us, it was all about ‘We’re going to help you find your superpower, WeWork is about more than just work,’” says a former employee.But the “energy of We” to which WeWork dedicated its IPO filing never quite materialized in the end — certainly not to save the company, change the world, or transform the global economy. “It ended up,” the former employee added dryly, “being just work.”Update: An earlier version of this piece misidentified the consequences for front-line staff if they didn’t sign paperwork within five days.Written by"
79,How To Make Any Person Open Up and Feel Deeply Connected to You,"“Remember that everyone you meet is afraid of something, loves something, and has lost something.”— H. Jackson Brown, Jr.How good is your ability to open up and deeply connect with other people? You can easily answer this question by thinking back to when and how often someone said one of the following sentences to you:If this is stuff people say to you regularly, congratulations: You certainly know how to open up other people and connect with them deeply. These questions reveal that someone found a confidant in you — a person they can trust and be honest, open, and vulnerable with.These are sentences that I have heard several times in my life, both from close friends and also from acquaintances and strangers that I have just met on that very day. I always noticed that people do confide in me easily. I used to think these were just coincidences — being in the right place at the right time.I also noticed, however, that this ability to connect deeply with other people, is the lifeblood of all the important relationships in my life. That’s why I did a six-month retrospective on my relationships. I wanted to examine how these connections and relationships started and how I can consciously take all my interactions to a higher level.This revealed two significant things:When analyzing the most vulnerable moments I had with others it also became clear to me that these moments of vulnerability, opening up, and connection are not due to random coincidence. There is, rather, a certain behavioral pattern you can control and that creates a sense of safety and protection for the other person.There are two vital conditions for the advice I share in the following paragraphs:Before you encourage someone to open up to you and to get under their skin, know that you have to be ready for this, too. A lot of people carry deep issues, and once they are ready to pour it all out, it can be very draining emotionally. There is nothing wrong with setting boundaries. If you are not in a state to hear about people’s traumas, that’s OK: Don’t encourage them to tell you.This is not a “social game” where you learn how to make more friends with some clever lines. Please stop reading if you are trying to “pick up,” manipulate, or otherwise play with other people’s vulnerability. If you want people to open up and trust you, do your best to be worthy of their trust and never take advantage of it. Furthermore, you don’t want to miss the real benefits of being a trustworthy person with deep connections.Noah Eisenkraft and Hillary Anger Elfenbein, professors of organizational behavior, link the ability to make others feel comfortable to a personality trait they call the affective presence. The study found that each person gives off a certain vibe, an emotional impact they have on others, regardless of how they are feeling.This means that you can be in a happy-jolly mood but still have a negative emotional impact on others. The same is true the other way around: People with depression can still have a positive emotional influence on others. There really seems to be an emotional signature to our way of being, which can either make people feel safe and good or put them off.Apart from the affective presence, however, it doesn’t say what exactly people are doing that puts others at ease and makes other people trust them. This article, though, gives you my personal formula to become a trustworthy person in others’ eyes, allowing people to be vulnerable with you and to create deep and lasting connections.Ever since Harry Harlow’s (in)famous monkey experiments, there is no doubt that connection and intimacy are vital for our health. But apart from surviving, trustworthiness and being a natural confidant also help you thrive.You become better at calming others and helping them deal with their uncertainties. You also learn to be helpful by supporting and encouraging the people around you, even if you cannot fix their problems. Having just a few people deeply confiding in you also has a significant impact on all your other relationships: You learn to understand others’ emotions, even if you are not going through them yourself (that’s empathy). As a result, you learn to embrace diversity and are able to connect with people that might be completely unlike you.In short: You become an overall more likable human being around whom people feel like they can be truly themselves.In his book “Don’t Sweat the Small Stuff,” famous psychotherapist Richard Carlson writes that “[b]eing listened to and heard is one of the greatest desires of the human heart.” Remember this when you’re in doubt about your ability to connect deeply. Everyone has the desire to open up, be vulnerable, and to establish deep connections with others.In the course of my interactions, I have found that there is a prerequisite and then two main stages of deep emotional connection.The prerequisite is a specific mindset that’ll make you an overall more trustworthy person.Stage 1 is where the interaction between you and others takes place — the stage of encouraging others to open up and to confide in you.Stage 2 is the stage of creating deep and lasting connections that’ll help you strengthen these relationships and acts of vulnerability.I will walk you through them step by step.The world is a harsh place. Judgment is everywhere, and you are probably no exception. Previously a legit survival instinct, today, judgment is the number one obstacle to meaningful connections.If people feel judged by you they will never trust you with anything. However, being non-judgmental is so much easier said than done. We judge people because of their clothes, their opinions and beliefs, and everything else in between.Being non-judgmental doesn’t mean that you have to agree and be on the same page with anyone. It simply means to give others the benefit of the doubt and — instead of assuming that people are lazy and act badly on purpose — believing that everyone is genuinely trying to be the best version of themselves.Here are some tips to quiet your judgmental voice a little.Simply stop judging how people dress and look. This is what we judge most often, and it’s nothing but time-consuming, unnecessary, and fuels low self-esteem, the beauty industry, and unrealistic standards of beauty. Try to become more conscious of how you feel about someone before interacting with them and question what that feeling is based upon.See it this way: If we would be judged by our worst 15 minutes, we would all be monsters.The next time you catch yourself about to judge how someone behaves or acts, think of your own worst 15 minutes, how others would have perceived you, and how that would feel. In other words: Be gentle to strangers—you never know what they are going through.Acknowledge that you never know the whole story of someone and their particular situation, even if it’s your closest friend or family member. You will never know what that person is truly feeling and how you would make decisions if you were them.Of course, you will never be completely free of judging others. It’s a basic instinct that helps us navigate other people and the world and what is and isn’t good for us. You should absolutely draw conclusions for yourself about other people’s behavior that affects you. Being non-judgmental is about forming no opinion about how other people look and what they do when it has not so much to do with you.The non-judgmental mindset described above needs to be the basis for any deep and opening conversation you have with others. There is no shortcut around it.The steps that follow now are about making others open up to you afterward.Very few people will feel comfortable talking about their inner world to multiple people at once, even if it’s their closest friends. That’s why setting the right premises is crucial. It has to be just the two of you talking. This doesn’t mean there cannot be other people and even friends around (like at a bigger gathering or party), but it must be just you who is listening.Yes, you! If you want other people to be vulnerable with you, you must be willing to be vulnerable with them. Deep connection happens over the rough stuff in life. Every single one of my very deep conversations started with me sharing something messy that the other person wasn’t aware of.How you do that is situation-dependent. If it’s a close friend, you can probably just burst out with something that you know relates to their life, too, in some way. If you are just getting to know someone, wait until they share something vaguely negative or a struggle of their life, then share one of yours that relates in some way and is possibly even worse.The above advice goes against every self-improvement book that tells you that you should listen without saying anything or relating the stuff of others to yourself at this stage. I disagree. I have found that people are more than happy to hear that they are not alone with their struggles, that similar things have happened to others and that they are not weirdos and don’t have to be afraid to talk about their life, because other people do it too.The deep listening comes at a later stage. At this time it is about putting the other person at ease, and being at ease yourself, and being okay with your problems is a great way to do so.ExamplePerson 1: I had an awful sleep last night; I just couldn’t fall asleep until 3 a.m.Person 2: That’s awful. I know how it feels. I had severe phases of insomnia and even felt like going crazy at some point. It’s the worst thing.Person 2 does two things here: He shows an understanding of a seemingly small problem Person 1 has. At the same time, they open up about a deeper, relating issue they have themselves.Most conversations would stop at “That’s awful.” One like this gives instant depth to the situation and will put the other person at ease.You needn’t have experienced the same thing to show empathy. Person 2 also could have responded, “That’s awful. I usually fall asleep right away, but I got very sleep deprived when we had our baby, and it’s the worst.” The key is to empathize—not trivialize, not try to one-up the experience, or give advice—but to show that you can share in what they are feeling within your own experience.Some questions are considered to be inherently taboo, depending on the situation. I argue that there are none or just very few taboo questions if you ask them the right way and don’t force someone into the corner with them.Most deep conversations stop because people are so afraid of digging deeper, don’t want to be nosy, or feel uncomfortable with the vulnerability being served to them on a plate. If a person got as far as sharing their secrets or inner struggles with you, it is very unlikely that they will be scandalized by you asking further questions. Quite the opposite, I have found that people feel rather relieved because you give them a kind of permission to talk further and show them your interest in what they have to say.In continuing the previous example, person 2 might ask, “Is there something on your mind that was keeping you up?”At this point, you have found your way through to empathic communication with another person. They are opening up to you and confiding in you. By being vulnerable yourself, you gave them a reason to trust you and share details with you they are usually not comfortable talking about.Maybe you as well have found someone you can share your stuff with. You have learned something new about the other person and can now see that there are endless possibilities for making heart-to-heart connections.Still, the most important part is yet to come. Having a good deep conversation is great, but it’s the long-lasting connection that matters.The next step is also a lot harder than just making other people confide in you in the first place. Most people will be happy to talk to someone openly once you have established a free, judgment-free space for them. The true connection with you, however, happens only if they feel good about themselves afterward — if they feel like they have trusted and confided in the right person.I have found that a deep connection has four main components. These are listening, hearing, understanding, and validating.“Being listened to and heard is one of the greatest desires of the human heart. And those who learn to listen are the most loved and respected.”— Richard CarlsonEarlier I wrote that making people open up to you in the first place isn’t as much about deep listening as it is about finding a connection and a way that they can relate to you. Once someone has become vulnerable with you and is sharing difficult stuff about their lives, once you have asked pressing questions that others are afraid to ask and are receiving answers to them — then is the time to truly listen.True listening is about making a conversation entirely about the other person, even in your mind. This not only means that you don’t interrupt with your own stuff, but that you direct your full attention towards the other person without thinking about what you can say next or how this relates to you.Good listening is only half of the story. It is hearing the other person that will really count. If you are wondering about the difference, imagine reading a book as an example: There is a giant difference between reading absent-mindedly and reading a book with a pencil in your hand and highlighting and taking notes at the most important parts. The latter is about really interpreting what the book is trying to communicate, instead of just reading with a wandering mind.If you have trouble truly hearing what other people are trying to communicate, imagine having a pencil in your hand and ask yourself what you would highlight and why when they are talking.One way to do this is the classic technique from active listening of paraphrasing what the other person is saying and saying it back to them.ExamplePerson 1: I can’t believe she did that. She doesn’t respect me at all!Person 2: By doing that, it seems she doesn’t respect you.People do notice when they are being truly listened to and heard, and they notice as well when they are not. That makes all the difference in an unsettling act of vulnerability for them.“The other person is always right.Always right about feelings.About the day he just experienced.About the fears (appropriate and ill-founded) in his life.About the narrative going on, unspoken, in his head.About what he likes and what he dislikes.You’ll need to travel to this place of ‘right’ before you have any chance at all of actual communication.”— Seth GodinSeth Godin brought true understanding straight to the point, but to further clarify the concept: When talking about feelings and personal experiences, there is no right or wrong. Indeed, the other person is always right about their perception of how things unfolded, even if it fundamentally differs from how you would experience the very same thing.That’s why you should never judge or correct someone’s inner voice — not even to yourself. Acknowledge that everyone experiences their own truth.All the problems we’re dealing with are real. No, most of us are not starving or experiencing gross oppression or prosecution. Our lives are safe. Even so, this doesn’t mean that we don’t have the right to experience emotional pain. Each person’s brain creates their own benchmark for worry, happiness, panic, sadness, and all the other feelings based on their personal experience and immediate environment.We do not only want to survive but thrive. If you think of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, physiological needs (the need to survive) and safety needs are only the bottom — the foundation upon which everything else is built. What follows is love and belonging, esteem, and self-actualization — vague terms that are different for each individual, but nevertheless always present.What’s more, keep in mind that we cannot choose our feelings about a particular situation. Yes, we can change our reaction to them and what they do to us, but it takes practice, and not everyone is there yet.The bottom line of understanding is: Just because someone is surviving doesn’t mean they’re thriving, and it does not mean they are not allowed to feel bad or complain.Finally, validation is your reaction to people’s vulnerability. While listening, hearing and understanding are mostly about you being quiet and approaching deep conversations with the right mindset and attitude.Validation is your verbal feedback to the other person, and it is what makes or breaks lasting connections.Validation means telling the other person that what they are experiencing is right, normal, and OK and that their feelings are justified. Most people (probably including you) beat themselves up not only about their problems, but also about their negative reactions to them. That’s why, to deal with any problem, we have to deal with our own conscience first.While you often won’t be able to directly solve other people’s problems, the bigger step towards creating meaningful connections is validating the other person’s right to feel the way they are feeling and to practice understanding towards their reaction.That’s why, before jumping to conclusions and/or giving advice, you want to try to take a step back instead. Most people don’t expect others to solve their problems; if they do, they will ask for your advice specifically. When people are opening up to you about their inner world, what they are really looking for is validation — the feeling that their feelings are being understood and justified.This consists of three main steps:Here are two examples to demonstrate this process:Example 1A friend of yours is complaining about her career and work situation:“I thought I would reach middle management by now. That is why I took this job in the first place. It’s an OK job, but I don’t love it. It doesn’t fulfill me in any way. At least I want more responsibility and scope of action.”Now, there are endless ways to react to this, but only a few are helpful if a deeper connection is what you are looking for.Identify:What your friend is feeling is a certain form of frustration.Name:“Ugh, this sounds really frustrating.Validate:I totally get that. It sucks when we feel like we’re not reaching our goals, even if we’ve just set them for ourselves.”That’s it — this is all that it takes to make the other person feel understood and validated. From here they are much more likely to elaborate further, ask for your advice, or simply keep talking and feel connected to you. They feel understood (or they have an opportunity to clarify or correct your misunderstanding.)Here are some examples that have the opposite effect:“Come on, you’re fine! It could be a lot worse. You have a good salary, and reaching middle management is not everything in life!”“Look at all the positive stuff! At least you have an OK job!”“Don’t worry about it too much. You’ll get there eventually!”While all of these can technically be true or well-meaning responses, they do nothing to help the other person feel understood and validated; they might even make them feel like they are complaining too much, or encourage them to shut down rather than open up.Example 2Suppose that you are talking with a person that is feeling bad about their appearance, although you think they look great.“I feel like I have gained weight, my skin got worse, and I really don’t have the confidence to go on a date these days, although I know I should if I don’t want to end up alone.”Identify:That person is experiencing insecurity.Name:Ugh, that’s bad. I get what you mean, sometimes it’s really hard to feel good about yourself.Validate:I think it’s completely OK, and you obviously don’t feel like dating on such days or weeks.Invalidating examples:“Are you kidding me? You look amazing! I wish I looked like you.”“YOU feel like you gained weight?! Look at ME!”“Come on, there are enough guys out there who don’t mind a few extra kilos.”It should obviously be the goal of the other person to see things more (body-)positively, get away from feeling frustrated to taking action and changing their situation, but they already know that; everyone already knows this. If taking action was the main issue, nobody would ever complain in this whole entire world.When we are opening up to others, we are usually not in search of advice and motivating calendar mottos but understanding. Which is good news, as being understanding is a lot easier than solving problems.While the above examples are pretty common. there are plenty of situations where you won’t be able to relate because youa) simply have no idea what it feels like, orb) actually think that the other person is whining and complaining too much.Some problems are worse than the common pains of everyday life, and luckily most people don’t have to experience them. Struggling to have children, losing someone beloved, or being seriously ill for example are (luckily) not common problems everyone can necessarily relate to.While you probably won’t be able to give advice, you can still validate the other person by showing them that you do understand their pain, even if you cannot grasp it and that their negative feelings are at a non-judgmental, safe space with you.Yes, sometimes we feel like people simply complain too much, especially if they do it repeatedly over an extended period, over the same problem without taking any action. As with anything else in life, know your boundaries. Practice common sense and don’t be afraid to let the other person know how you’re feeling about this. If you’re annoyed from the start on the other hand, then this is probably someone you don’t want to deeply connect to, and that is also OK.In the end, connecting with other people and pretty much anyone you meet boils down to the following key ingredients:If you see it that way, there is so much about our relationships that are entirely in our control. This is good news, as this means that we all have it in us to go beyond the superficial and establish deep human connections. If you take care of your own behavior first, limit your judgments as much as possible, and go around with an open heart and mind, people will be naturally drawn to you.Taking my connections with others to a more conscious and intentional level changed my human relationships in a positive way. It helps me be a lot more in control about my boundaries—whom to open up and whom not. It also helps me tremendously in strengthening all my relationships, be it with friends, family, or romantically.I also figured out how little actual advice people usually want and expect from the ones being closest to them. If you are unsure about where to start, here are two things that you can do immediately:You don’t have to follow through with all the steps above every time. Always start with the first steps, see what happens, and how far things go.Remember that what your friends, partners, and family are looking for is being listened to, heard, understood, validated, and — most of all — not being judged about what they feel.This is great because, even if we don’t have all the answers, what we all do have is two ears, a heart, and a muscle for empathy that we can train. That’s all it usually takes to make any person open up and feel deeply connected to you.“Connection is the energy that is created between people when they feel seen, heard, and valued.”— Brené BrownWritten by"
80,How an E-Bike Got Me off the Couch and Back in Love with Exercise,"Let me stand up before this little corner of the web and testify: My name is Eric, I’m 53 years old, and I’m a couch potato. I do try and eat healthy. I take walks now and then. I even play the drums a little. But otherwise, I’m probably a lot like you. I sit at a desk for work, I watch too much TV, I’m addicted to my phone, and I’m worn out most of the time. My energy level stinks. I wake up tired. I’ve got the burned-out blues.I know I need to exercise. Just about every year, right around January, I make an action plan. I join a gym. I get all fired up. I go a few times. I hate it. By April, I’m done.I should be better. I’m just not.My guess is, if you’re an athlete in awesome shape, you’ve probably stopped reading this by now. You’re out training for an IRONMAN. OK, good for you. I’m authentically jealous.But if you’re like most people I know, you understand exactly what I’m talking about. You want to feel better and you want to exercise more, but you’re not motivated to do it.One thing I do love, and have always loved, is riding a bicycle. Those first few cranks on the pedals as I leave the driveway have always fired me with joy. Then I hit the first hill, and I’m filled with regret. I start thinking about the end of the ride, rather than relishing the experience itself. It becomes a means to an end — an exercise. What an ugly word. It might as well be spelled with four letters.It turns out, this makes me a perfect candidate for an electric bike.I discovered e-bikes in a casual way, through a reference in a mainstream publication. It sounded almost too good to be true — a workout that included words like fun. So I set off on a deep exploration to learn all I could about what is still a somewhat nascent technology. After about nine months of intensive (some might say obsessive) research, careful savings, and possibly driving the people in my life a little crazy, I bought one.And I just want to say: I’m in love. All I want to do is ride the thing. I’ve woken up at 5:45 (yes, that’s a.m.) just so I could. I have postponed coffee just so I could. I have left work early on false pretenses just to beat the February sunset home. I have frozen my ass off in the New Jersey winter for an extra 15 minutes of pedaling because I didn’t want to pull into the driveway yet. And I have not felt so energized in years — not since I was a kid, back when I used to ride a bike everywhere.An e-bike is an absolute joy to ride. The day I got mine home and set the motor assist to Eco, which is the lowest level, and cruised down my street, I was smitten. Then I hit the hill that always makes me regret going for a bike ride. I popped it into turbo mode, the highest level of support — and I was the bionic man. I just spun right up the thing. So I headed to the other hill of misery in my neighborhood, which I used to try to avoid, but often could not — same thing. A complete blast. So I went looking for hills. I hit the biggest rise in the park, which forces most people off their bikes — and flew up as if going over flat ground.I did seven miles that first ride. I did ten miles the next day. Seventeen miles of biking in one weekend. That’s more exercise, in two days, than I probably got over the whole winter. This can’t be a bad thing.Since that first ride, I’ve been trying to find the words to explain what’s so compelling about an electric bike. What I’ve come down to is this: It feels like flying. That’s as close to the description I can offer. When you sense that gentle support of the motor—and it’s gentle, very subtle, not like an engine, more like a little push from a magical hand—the sensation is similar to taking off into air. I think it’s the reason people get hooked so quickly when they try one.I believe if you ever rode one, you’d fall in love too. So allow me to dispel one of the biggest myths going.First, an electric bike is not a scooter or a moped. There are plenty of scooters and moped-type things out there. But an electric bike is a bicycle. It requires human pedal power. When I get back from a ten-mile cruise, I assure you, I’m both huffing and puffing. I promise, you’ll be tired when you’re done. You’ll have had a workout.But what it offers, unlike a regular bicycle (sometimes referred to as an analog bike), is an intelligent, pedal-assist system that does one primary thing—it flattens out the road. It lets you pedal without the burden—and agony—of climbing. It turns a three- or four-mile effort into 10 or 20 miles of delight. And so you end up spinning perhaps five times as much as you might have otherwise. Instead of a 20-minute ride, you find yourself out for an hour. Or more.Now, for some, this is the deal breaker. You want to climb mountains. You want to build muscle. You want to push your endurance to its limit.Go ahead. E-bikes might not be for you.But if you’re like every other couch potato out there, e-bikes are the perfect confluence of exercise and pleasure—two words which have never been used in a sentence that’s come out of my keyboard before.E-bikes are essentially smart devices. They sense the effort you’re putting into them and give back just the amount of support you need. This mostly happens on hills, when you push harder on the pedals and need the help. When you’re on flat ground, and in a lower assist level, you feel like the wind is at your back. You’re working — but making tangible progress all the time. It’s the bionic-leg thing—you feel invincible. It is, in a word, spectacular. I wish you could ride one right now. I wish I could ride one right now. It’s that addictive.And it’s good for you. I don’t want to bore you with statistical evidence; there are numerous studies proving the aerobic benefit of e-bikes compares favorably to analog biking. Like this one. I’m not saying one is better. Both have benefits. But beyond the research, what matters is how you feel, and for me, I’ve found an exercise that gets my heart rate moving and that I absolutely love doing. This is a remarkable discovery for an avowed couch potato.OK, assuming I’ve won you over to the concept, it can be daunting — even overwhelming — to get started. So after spending way too many hours at forums, on Reddit, and with YouTube, here’s a starter set of basics I found helpful.Just like any analog bike, e-bikes come in different flavors — mountain bikes, road bikes, racing bikes, hybrids, etc. This alone can be confusing, even before deciding on hub-motor vs. mid-drive, battery size, and the rest of the electronic decisions. To narrow this down, and given the cost of these things (more on that below), I decided to start with the most utilitarian type out there. For me, this meant something for the road but something that could also work on light paths and gravel.So I chose a commuter, or hybrid style: front shocks to lighten the ride, fenders for the rain, integrated lights for visibility to cars, 700c tires (these are in between fat tires for off-road and skinny tires for racing). This seemed like a good compromise that’d cover the majority of my rides — from the street to the towpath along the river and light trails through the park.You can’t get past this one. A good bike, even without a motor, is a pricey proposition. Given the speeds you can go (up to 28 mph, in the U.S.), an e-bike needs to be substantial and reliably engineered with good components—and this means cost. Yes, you can take a DIY approach and build your own e-bike, but this wasn’t an option for a novice like me (though, it could be for you—more on that below).And here’s where the overload of information can really make you crazy — because the more you read, the more you want. And you can easily spend five grand—or ten—for an e-bike. You can also spend $50,000 or $90,000 on a car, but many people buy Hondas or Fords (or whatever) and stick to a budget.This is what I chose to do—and I forced myself to abide by it. For me, this meant $1,500 to $3,000. Still a lot of money, for sure. It took some time to save. But I chose to see this as a health enhancement, possibly even a life extender. This felt like a fair exchange of cost versus return.This was a tough one because there are some very compelling online, direct-to-consumer options that reduce the cost. And I was tempted because people on forums and Facebook groups truly seem to love them. Ultimately, it’s just not a route for me—but this is no knock on those options. This is a personal choice, and it doesn’t have to be yours.I’m a complete novice—I both need and prefer a local bike shop (LBS, in the hipster parlance) to lean on for help. But beyond that, buying an e-bike, to my thinking, is a lot like buying a car — I wouldn’t do it without driving one first. And each e-bike has its own unique feel and style, which you discover as you start to test them.For instance, do you want a mid-drive or a hub-drive? Cadence sensor or torque sensor? Mountain or road bike? Rigid or suspension fork? Upright or forward-leaning? These are all very different rides, even from the same manufacturer, and while there are guidelines, all the online forums on the internet won’t give you the hands-on experience to evaluate against your personal preference.So I committed to choosing a bike I could actually ride — and to keep within about an hour’s car distance from the dealer. As I write this, e-bikes are still enough of a novelty that the local options can be limiting. For me, this narrowed the choice to the “Big Three” — Giant, Trek, and Specialized. If I were open to extending things past 90 minutes, it meant Bulls, Yamaha, Haibike, Pedego, and a few others. All good choices, it seems to me.I’m not going to suggest which brand is better. People get very touchy about that. The one I ultimately chose hit all the right buttons: It’s an entry-level value e-bike with generally solid, though not top-end components; it has hydraulic brakes, which I felt were important for stopping power; it’s a mid-drive motor with torque assist (which centers the weight and some say gives a more bike-like feeling than cadence sensors or hub-drives in the rear wheel); at 54 lbs, it’s light enough to fit on most hitch-based car racks; it has a very quiet motor; it was under my budget (barely).I couldn’t be happier — but there are lots of options, and this might not be the specific one for you. The point is, go test! The bike shops I visited were all very accommodating and let me ride and ride.I can’t offer any words of experience here because I’m not really a DIY kind of guy. That said, there are voluminous guides online (check the resources below) that help you take an analog bike and build an electronic system with motor, display, and the rest. It certainly reduces the cost. I’d argue there’s an extra value in a purposefully engineered, holistic system that justifies the higher cost of a mainstream, well-tested, manufactured e-bike. But I’m not advocating for the manufacturers; it just made sense for me.Inevitably, you are going to hear: “That’s cheating.” I’ve already heard it a bunch of times, and I’ve only been riding a few weeks. I try to laugh it off with some ruddy good cheer because in some ways I get it — and, more importantly, I want people to embrace the concept because there are both physical and planetary benefits to be had by the ubiquitous adoption of e-bikes. So friendly engagement seems like it has the best chance of opening someone’s mind.But inside, a part of me wants to snarl, because calling an e-bike cheating is rather silly. Am I cheating myself? I’m getting more prolonged, intense, sustained aerobic exercise then I’ve gotten in decades. My energy level is through the roof, and I just feel full of—I don’t know—energy and peace, at the same time. Just having the motivation to write this article, for instance, is something that’s been lacking in my life, and I love words. I used to write all the time. So there’s no cheating myself here. On the contrary: I’ve experienced a profound life change.Am I cheating you? If you want to run marathons, swim across the English Channel, or jump out of an airplane, go for it. It seems to me our exercise choices are personal, just like the diet we follow or where we live or our parenting philosophy or career choices.Am I cheating other bikers? I guess if I was struggling up a mountain, and someone came buzzing along on an electric bike, I’d be a little ticked off. Because I’d be doing all this work. But again, someone chooses to struggle up a mountain. Am I cheating if I drive my car?And besides, the biggest point here is there is no cheating going on. I’m riding a fabulous exercise bike, only instead of sitting still at the gym staring at CNN (which, taking my own argument, is perfectly fine for those who enjoy that), I’m out in the breeze and the sun and air.And if you still insist I’m cheating, then I’ll pull over and let you take a spin. I promise you’ll fall in love — and quickly, too.There’s a wealth of information online for e-bikes. Here’s where I’ve spent most of my time:So be smart and be prepared. And have fun!Written by"
81,How to Build the Speedy Home Wi-Fi Network of Your Dreams,"Even if you’re paying for decent internet, there’s always that one corner of the house where Netflix stutters and buffers. Solving this problem and getting the absolute best speeds throughout your home can’t be done with standard hardware. It requires building a custom network.I came to this realization last year when I upgraded to a 1.5Gbps fiber connection. Fed up with the dead spots, I went down a rabbit hole in pursuit of the fastest, most reliable network I could build. Consumer-focused hardware such as Google Wifi and Eero don’t provide much control. Home mesh tools like Nest Wifi are designed to help plug holes in your Wi-Fi but aren’t generally focused on maximum speed and coverage. The best solution I found was Ubiquiti’s UniFi devices — business-grade network hardware that can be used at home.I first heard about UniFi devices through Twitter, but what hooked me were the communities of passionate fans in places like Reddit’s /r/ubiquiti who post pictures of the fancy dashboards and elaborate home Wi-Fi setups they’ve built with the products. It wasn’t long after I started following these communities that I started plotting my own dream network. While there are other options, like MikroTik or Linksys, Ubiquiti offers an end-to-end ecosystem that’s much more user friendly.With my home network makeover, I’m now able to get a solid 700Mbps-plus of wireless internet speeds, reliably, without any dead zones, whether I’m in bed watching Netflix, downstairs in the kitchen, or anywhere else in my house. (That’s still not quite the 1.5Gbps I’m paying for, but it’s a huge improvement considering my ISP provides a router with wired ports capped at 1Gbps.) My custom network is reliable, and I can make infinite Wi-Fi networks—a separate network for guests, for instance—and control them remotely.Building a network like this isn’t for the faint of heart. It takes a bit of learning and a willingness to spend some money on hardware. It also requires a shift in thinking: You’re building a network made up of multiple pieces, rather than plugging in a single device. But if you’re willing to make the investment in better Wi-Fi, have a technical mind, and are up for a challenge, it’s simple enough to learn.UniFi devices work a little differently than traditional home networks. Each device in the network is a distinct piece that operates independently.Here are the pieces you’ll need to get started:This is the software that acts as the network’s centralized brain and allows you to control and set up multiple individual network devices from a single interface. In a UniFi network, the controller is responsible for the settings of each device, which aren’t able to do much independently.This is the device your internet connection comes into — likely from a router provided by your ISP. It provides firewall protection and insights into your network, like which websites are being used the most and the quality of the Wi-Fi signal for each computer on your network.The benefits of a gateway can be hard to wrap your head around at first, but it’s an important piece of the setup that I recommend for getting the most out of UniFi. Generally speaking, you plug your ISP’s modem into one port on this device and your internal network on the other side, separating the two entirely.You’ll plug hardwired devices into these ports to extend your network.These hubs beam the actual wireless network to devices like your laptop or phone.You have two options when it comes to choosing a controller for your custom Wi-Fi network. A standalone controller, called the Cloud Key ($179), hosts the UniFi software and controls your other devices. A newer option, introduced in 2019, is an all-in-one device called the Dream Machine ($299), which combines the controller, gateway, and access point.If you’re new to building complex networks, I highly recommend the Dream Machine. It is much easier to set up and run.If you have a UniFi Dream Machine, it already includes a gateway. If you’ve gone the traditional controller route, you must buy a gateway separately, adding to the total cost. You have a few options: the UniFi Security Gateway ($139), the UniFi Security Gateway Pro ($344), or the high-end all-in-one UniFi Dream Machine Pro ($379), a supercharged version of the Dream Machine focused on raw speed and doesn’t include an access point like the base model.The easiest way to make this decision is to look at your internet speed. If it’s under 750Mbps, the UniFi Security Gateway won’t cap out your speeds with its limited processing power. If you’re on 1Gbps, the Security Gateway Pro is a better choice. Anything higher makes the Dream Machine Pro the only good option.To allow all of your devices to communicate with one another, you’ll need a piece of hardware with a bunch of ports, called a switch. Your Wi-Fi hubs, or access points, will plug into this device in order to connect to the network. Because the hubs include a technology called Power over Ethernet (PoE), which sends enough electricity over the network cable to power up the device on the other end, they don’t need to be plugged into a power socket.UniFi network switches come with varying numbers of ports. For a small home network with only a few wired devices, the UniFi Switch PoE 8 ($199) is more than adequate. For larger networks or to future-proof your setup, there are 16-port ($299) and 24-port options ($399).If you chose the Dream Machine controller route, you already have one access point, but the entire reason to invest in a system like this is to cover your home with Wi-Fi, and you’ll need two or more access points to get the most out of UniFi. You can connect these either via an Ethernet cable or wirelessly (called Wireless Uplink in UniFi’s software), but at the cost of some speed and reliability.Here are some popular options:If you’d like to mount on a wall or roof: UniFi nanoHD ($179). The nanoHD is a tiny round access point that includes a kit for mounting it directly on a roof or wall.If you have in-wall Ethernet already available: UniFi In-Wall HD ($179). For homes that already have ethernet ports in the walls, the UniFi In-Wall options are fantastic, as they can be installed right on top of the existing Ethernet faceplate. If you have ports available, this is the best choice.For everything else: UniFi FlexHD ($179). For renters like me or for those who don’t want to mount their devices, the FlexHD is a cute access point that’s about the size of a Coke can. It can stand up on its own and be tucked away out of sight or mounted on all sorts of things, including poles. It’s even waterproofed for outdoor use.Other options: If you head to the Ubiquiti store, you’ll notice there are a ton of options available. That’s because UniFi works for everything from elaborate home Wi-Fi to stadium-sized venues, and the company provides different products for each use case. The UniFi HD ($349), for example, supports a theoretical 1,000 users connected at once.Here is what my own home network looks like:The UniFi Dream Machine simplified getting started. Once I plugged it in and typed in a URL, I found myself on an easy-to-use setup wizard. From there, I added the other hardware, piece by piece. I put a UniFi Switch 24 PoE hidden in the basement to act as the core of the network. I chose UniFi FlexHD and nanoHD access points—one for the first floor and one for the basement.Because our home is rented and isn’t wired for network cables, it was a little challenging to get physical wires to the places I needed.My solution, likely to the dismay of any advanced readers, was rather crude: massive, cheap rolls of flat Ethernet cables that I jammed in windows and ran on the outside of the house, which works well enough but isn’t something I’d recommend if you can avoid it.Now I have control over every minute detail of my home network. A “Wi-Fi experience” score, for example, shows how a device is experiencing connectivity, with lower scores indicating a dead patch or difficulty connecting. I can create infinite separate Wi-Fi networks, which I’ve done to create a guest network and to separate internet of things devices from those on my main network to ensure smart appliances aren’t able to snoop into my other devices without my knowledge.The best feature by far is the ability to control multiple UniFi networks remotely. This is useful for quickly fixing something at home while I’m traveling, for example.By the standards of the UniFi geeks on Reddit, my system is not very complex, but it’s simple to grow if I move into a larger home in the future, and it allows total control. Unlike a modern consumer-focused meshing product like Google’s Nest Wifi, which requires logging in with a Google account to use it, I’m in control of my data and responsible for it.And if nothing else, learning about networking and building out a future-proof setup is a fun hobby.Written by"
82,7 Ways to Uproot Your Anti-Fat Bias,"The conversation is always the same and no less heartbreaking for its familiarity.After days, weeks, months of talking with their fat friends and family, a straight-size person (that is, someone who doesn’t wear plus sizes) realizes that anti-fat bias isn’t just the work of devoted bigots, bad actors hell-bent on tormenting fat people. Something has clicked into place: She now realizes that the bias lives and breathes within her, too.Anti-fat bias is, she finally understands, something she’s been perpetuating and replicating without even realizing it or meaning to. Every well-intended weight loss compliment, every “sweetie, no, you’re not fat!” now stings. Everything she’s learned to say now feels wrong, but she doesn’t know how to revise her old scripted lines or what she’d put in their place. And it isn’t just a matter of what she says but how she thinks. She finds herself overwhelmed, longing for somewhere to start, something to absolve her of all this guilt she now believes herself to have earned.The truth is, there is no checklist of anti-fat bias. There are no tidy steps to an escape hatch, no ejector seat to launch us out of the body-based beliefs we’ve developed. There is only the long, complex work of learning to see each other again. There is only the discipline of holding ourselves to new standards. There is only relearning how to see our humanity reflected in those around us—regardless of their bodies.Many of us think of ourselves as egalitarians, so acknowledging any biases, even subconscious biases, can threaten our very self-image.That work is long, complex, and soul-searching, yes, but there are clear starting points and clear measures of progress. There will be moments of epiphany and revelation, moments of divinity and eureka. But despite all that gospel, there is no moment of salvation, no benediction to deliver us from a system that has so meticulously trained each of us in its work. There is only the work of learning to love more, learning to care deeper, learning to respect one another, even when we struggle to understand.Here are some places to start that work.It’s difficult for any of us to face our own biases — and it’s even harder when we may not believe we have biases to confront. Many of us think of ourselves as egalitarians, so acknowledging any biases, even subconscious biases, can threaten our very self-image.But when it comes to bias against fat people, the data is clear. Fat people are less likely to be hired, with 85% of hiring managers saying they wouldn’t even consider hiring a fat woman. More than a third of medical students harbor significant prejudice against fat people — and they’re unaware of it. And, according to researchers at Harvard University, implicit bias against fat people rose significantly between 2007 and 2016. That is, anti-fat bias has been on the rise in recent years and may still be.All of us in the U.S. (and many other nations) are products of a society that hates and fears fatness, seeking to eliminate it wherever it appears. We’ve spent a lifetime being conditioned to perpetuate anti-fat bias without question — even to justify it. That conditioning isn’t our fault, but it is our responsibility.Start by taking Harvard University’s Implicit Attitudes Test on weight bias, which can help measure the unconscious bias that informs our thinking and actions every day. Acknowledge that those biases have likely hurt fat people, or have done something to uphold the exclusion or scapegoating of fat people. After all, most of us have done something, big or small, to perpetuate anti-fat bias. Denying that may feel more comfortable, but acknowledging our bias and its possible harms are the first steps to addressing it and doing better.Anti-fat bias thrives on the idea that fat people are aberrant, that we are exceptions to a more penitent, thin rule. Anti-fat bullying and behavior are often predicated on the idea that if fat people tried harder, they could be as thin as the rest of us. But “the rest of us” are fat. In the United States, 70% of people are fat. Yet still, so many of us are trained to see fat people as a pitiable exception and a failure.So use your media and social media consumption to build a world that looks more like ours, and that includes a wider array of bodies. Fill your Instagram feeds with fat people who are your size and fatter. Find bodies that look like yours, sure, and be sure to find bodies that don’t. Find fat folks of color, fat disabled people, fat trans people, fat people whose bodies fall outside the realm of what you’ve been taught to idealize.Learn from fat people. Read the work of fat writers like Roxane Gay and Kiese Laymon, Julie Murphy, and S. Bear Bergman. Read closely, carefully, tenderly. Take heed of fat folks’ experiences, and notice where those experiences buck your expectations or make you want to withdraw. Learn to listen to what you’ve been taught to disregard.What myths about size and weight do you hold onto? Is it that fat people could lose weight if we tried? (The odds of a very fat person reaching their BMI-recommended weight are less than 1%.) Is it that fat people are lazy, and should just get off our couches? (Over 60 studies have shown that exercise doesn’t necessarily lead to weight loss.) Is it that we all just need to go on a diet? (95% of dieters regain any weight they lose — even if they call it a “lifestyle change.”) Or is it that anti-fat bias is overblown or simply doesn’t exist? (It does, and it appears to be on the rise.)Whatever it is, chances are it’s not based in research — it’s based in a series of pervasive cultural myths that have long since been debunked or, at the very least, challenged by a broad range of medical and academic studies in recent decades. If you find yourself struggling with those truisms, go straight to the source — find peer-reviewed studies on the ways weight stigma worsens eating disorders, the effects of social exclusion on fat people, or how weight stigma may actually drive the so-called obesity epidemic. Research may not release you from your beliefs, but it will expose them as just that: not facts but beliefs. And those beliefs are often weaponized against fat people to justify our erasure and mistreatment.This, then, is the meat of it: taking an inventory of the harms we suspect we may have caused. Spend some time thinking of how your anti-fatness shows up in your relationship to your own body. These will likely flow easily, if painfully. Think of the ways you’ve sought to change your body through diets that may have given way to eating disorders, cosmetic treatments that may have given way to dysmorphia. Think of what you’ve learned from your parents, siblings, friends. Think of how you’ve been taught to see your own body and the blame you’ve learned to heap upon it. This may be painful, but acknowledging these not as facts but as errant beliefs is a critical step to letting them drift away from you.Now spend some time thinking about how your anti-fatness shows up in your relationship to others’ bodies. If you’ve got anything in the first column, you’ve definitely got stuff in the second column. Feeling stuck? Take a look at some of these common examples of everyday fat-shaming or this primer on anti-fat microaggressions from a weight stigma researcher.Once you’ve done that, spend some time writing or talking about these two lists. What themes do you notice? Where did you learn your beliefs and actions? What will it take to uproot them? And what’s one easy behavior with which you might start?Some possible starting places:As you are building your inventory, you will undoubtedly come up short. Each of us has learned to hide our biases from ourselves, tucking them behind justifications and squirreling them out of sight. As in any anti-oppression work, getting feedback will be important. So talk to the fat folks in your life. Ask what their body-related experiences have been in the world around them, and with you. Ask if there are ways you can better support them. Then make a plan to begin to do those things.Education and introspection are good — but they only make a substantive difference if they change our actions. And too often, our cultural conversations focus on how we see our own bodies and stop short before addressing how our behavior impacts those around us.When you see anti-fat bias in action, interrupt it. What you say doesn’t have to be perfect, nor does it need to lead to an immediate change in someone else’s behavior. It just needs to set a boundary and illustrate to those around you that you won’t tolerate anti-fatness. Remember that interrupting anti-fat bias isn’t just a matter of changing the behavior of a biased person — it also sends a powerful message to the fat people around you. Many fat people have a lifetime of experience of being publicly shamed without anyone else backing us up. Prove us wrong. If you believe that you are a safer, kinder, more egalitarian person than most, show us. Speak up.These steps are not insignificant nor are they without challenges. You will feel defensive, mischaracterized, challenged, or maligned in the process. Right or wrong, those feelings of discomfort and defensiveness have something to teach you. What about your worldview is being threatened by doing this work? What narratives and experiences are you trying to protect? And how or why might better learning to respect fat folks’ wishes pose a threat to those narratives? Do you need those narratives to protect you in any way, or are they part of the same machine that’s hurt you, too?Learn to listen to your own discomfort and defensiveness. It has a lot to teach you. But you can’t learn if you don’t listen.These are beginnings, brave first steps on ground that shifts beneath your feet. They will challenge you, stretch you, nourish you, feed you. Some will come with feelings of shame, others with feelings of liberation. But all of them will lead you back to your body. And all of them will help you see fat people in ours.Written by"
83,Why I’ve Never Tasted Alcohol and Am Not About to Start,"When I tell people I don’t drink alcohol, I see them stiffen, as though I’m denying my birthright or weaseling out of a contract. Sometimes their next words take a defensive tone: they don’t drink much, just once in awhile, like on Christmas or New Year’s or birthdays. At other times when I decline a drink, I’m met with skepticism. The person might offer a second time, as if I just needed a moment to think about it, or they might tease me with “Are you suuuurrrre you don’t want one?” It’s a variation on trying to get kids to eat broccoli: “Just try it. You might like it.”A lot of writers drink. David Mamet describes his first taste of a particular whiskey almost lovingly: “It was dark and rich and not at all sweet, and quite sharp without being bitter, and it tasted overridingly of smoke and, curiously, of iodine.” P.G. Wodehouse told a friend, “I have come to the conclusion that gin and Italian vermouth are the greatest thing in life.” William James didn’t especially like alcohol, but he saw its utility, writing of its power to “stimulate the mystical faculties of human nature, usually crushed to earth by the cold facts and dry criticisms of the sober hour.”Others have turned sobriety into gonzo journalism. Augusten Burroughs’s memoir Dry was a New York Times bestseller. Sacha Z. Scoblic, Michael Pond, Pete Hamill, Nancy L. Carr, Sarah Hepola, Amber Tozer, Heather King, Caroline Knapp, Clare Pooley, Mary Karr, Sarah Ordo, Rebecca Weller, Rachel Black, Elizabeth Vargas, Jenna Hollenstein, Nancy Stearns Bercaw, Jennifer Storm, and Mark Tuschel, and Neil Steinberg have also penned memoirs focused on alcohol addiction. The Dry January movement makes headlines every year, with an estimated five million participants in 2017. Another trend is Juice Crawl, a pub-crawl alternative where people go to different shops and sample far-out, nonalcoholic beverages.At least these people know what they’re missing. I, on the other hand, have never tasted alcohol. Not once in 44 years. And I never will. When people tell stories that begin with, “Man, I was so wasted last night,” I say “Wow” or “Sucks to be you” as appropriate, and muster up a laugh when they get to the part where they fell asleep in Maine and woke up in Georgia — but this is stagecraft. When movie or TV characters drink, I can’t watch. In Murder at 1600, Dennis Miller sits in a bar and rants, “Everything’s about numbers. Two drinks a day? Healthy. Three? You’re an alcoholic.” My number, healthy or not, is zero. Walking past the wine in the grocery store, I imagine smashing the colored bottles, their contents dripping down the shelves, pooling on the floor like blood. Just saying the word “drunk” makes my skin feel briny.There’s a new term for people who are questioning their alcohol intake and considering cutting down or quitting altogether: sober curious. But this applies to people who have known the taste of alcohol. What would you call me? How would you label my total avoidance? “Abstinence” is the obvious choice. It is better than “temperance,” which means moderation, or “self-denial,” which suggests I’m missing out on something. But people who try something, hate it, and swear it off forever can also be called abstinent. “Teetotaler” would work, though it is a rococo word, while “virgin,” as in “virgin taste buds,” feels moralistic. “Untouched,” “unblemished,” “spotless,” “chaste” — these are goody-goody words. None seem quite right.My father was a Southern Baptist pastor. Historically, Baptists have rejected alcohol entirely. In the Prohibition era, they could be “churched” — banned from services — if they were caught drinking. That practice was long gone by the time I was born, yet I grew up seeing drinking as tainted. My mother would not let me watch Cheers because it was set in a bar. My grandfather would leave the room when a beer commercial came on TV. My father was less extreme (he even liked Cheers), but when he saw beer cans or liquor bottles pitched into our yard, he would send me to pick them up, saying not that they looked trashy but that “someone might think they’re ours.”Most kids grow up watching adults drink socially. Not me. My childhood was awash in abstinence, and not just at home. I grew up in the 1980s, in the midst of D.A.R.E. and “Just Say No.” Narcotics officers would visit my school, flaunting their samples of needles, bongs, airplane glue, little white pills, baggies of powders, and crispy marijuana leaves. They talked about potheads and burnouts and binge drinkers, people so scabrous they downed NyQuil or perfume when the booze ran out. The visits worked; my classmates and I were suitably scared by these horror stories of drug and alcohol abuse. As we got older, though, my friends’ fear of alcohol wore off, whereas mine was just getting started. I remember in seventh grade when a girl in my class was telling a story about her boyfriend getting drunk. She slumped in her seat and rolled back her eyes to imitate how he had looked. Everyone laughed. Everyone but me.My aversion to drinking was reinforced at home. As a pastor, my father counseled alcoholics. Accompanied them to A.A. meetings. Helped them set goals. Cheered their successes, talked over their slippages. Preached at their funerals, if all else failed. Of all his counselees, Robert is the one he can’t forget. Robert didn’t attend our church, but his wife did. One night, she called my father and asked him to come over because Robert was drunk. When my father arrived, Robert was in no condition to talk, so he went back the next night. Soon he was going there once a week. At first, Robert was eager to reform. Then he backslid. One day he called our house, drunker than usual, and asked my father to come pick him up. “I’ll be right there,” my father said. He went to get Robert, but this time, instead of driving him home, he took him to Dorothea Dix, a psychiatric hospital. During the drive, Robert threw up in the back seat of our burgundy Buick LeSabre.Three days later, my father went back to the hospital and met with Robert in his room. “Robert,” he said, sitting beside him on the bed, “I think you should check into a long-term treatment center.”Robert looked at him in surprise. “Is that what my wife wants me to do?”“Yes.”Robert got off the bed and walked to the window. No doubt he heard the unspoken threat: your wife will leave you if you pass up this chance. Perhaps she had threatened to leave in the past as well, her foreboding words a routine part of his hangover.Finally, he turned to my father. “No,” he said. “I’m not going to do it.”Maybe Robert thought he could control his drinking. Maybe he thought like Jack London, who wrote in his autobiographical novel John Barleycorn, “I would drink — but oh, more skillfully, more discreetly than ever before. Never again would I be a peripatetic conflagration.” London wrote this right after a tumultuous visit to New York in 1912. His wife Charmian later wrote that the city had “reached into him and plucked to light the least admirable of his qualities.” He told her he was going on one last bender, but promised that when they sailed for Cape Horn later that year, “it was to be ‘Good-bye, forever, to John Barleycorn.’”London may or may not have found restraint. He never had another bad binge, but his death in 1916, some believe, was a suicide. There is no ambiguity with Robert’s demise: he eventually shot himself in the head.People drink for many reasons: to escape, to gain confidence, to spend a few hours not caring about work or relationship troubles or the Trump presidency. That alcohol has such power is seductive, and there are times I, like anyone, want to be seduced.But I won’t take a drink. It’s not only a fear of alcoholism that keeps me teetotal. I am afraid of the thing everyone wants from alcohol: being altered. I think it would change me at my core. I would be a reconstituted me, an added-to me. I am afraid of drinking for the same reason I am afraid of roller coasters. Both can take you to the precipice of control, which is too close for me.Am I irrational? Perhaps. Everyone is irrational at times. When I think about Robert and others like him, I know I should feel sorry for them. I should, but I don’t. You’ve heard of mean drunks? I guess I am a mean sober.I have gotten better, however. My daughter, who is almost 21, wants to go to bartending school. Her older sister drinks occasionally. My in-laws keep a bottle of Southern Comfort around the house, and I see them break it out on Christmas or New Year’s Eve. If they’re watching football, they’ll have a beer or two.All this makes me uncomfortable, but I endure it. I don’t suppose I’ll ever have a mainstream view of drinking. Not that I need one. People don’t need to get married, women don’t need to have children, and virgins don’t need to have sex. We could all stand to overlook those moments when others don’t follow our script. I realize that my contempt for alcoholics is unhealthy, and I will work hard to change that. It can be done, even at my age. But if you invite me into your home, and you offer me a drink, and I demur, know that it isn’t about you, it’s about me.And don’t try to serve me broccoli, either. I never touch the stuff.Written by"

85,Advance Your Python Skills by Building a WhatsApp Chat Analyzer,"Finding ways to apply your knowledge only after the learning process essentially means that the learning happened without much of a sense of destination. All we were trying to do was amass all the knowledge we could in the hope that it’d come of use in some distant, mystical future.Doesn’t that feel like procrastination?I believe in an approach to learning that emphasizes doing projects.When you try to make something, you discover a hundred things you don’t know. You discover things you thought you knew but don’t really know. You trip over things that seemed so simple you didn’t even pay attention to them. You fill the gaps in your learning.Also, it’s super fun and adventurous.You can get all that only if you do a project. So I think that it’s worth it to center your entire learning around completing a project.If you want to dive into building something interesting and learn useful Python/programming skills along the way, this guide is for you.With this guide, I aim to walk you through building something interesting, allowing you to experience difficult-to-grab programming intuitions as you build it. Hopefully, you go from a basic Pythonista to an advanced one.But, most importantly, I want to give you motivation and the incentive for you to teach yourself.Here are some textbook skills that you’ll pick up:But this isn’t a textbook. So along with them, you’ll also develop intuitions about good programming practices like:Let’s get to it then.OK, so here’s the idea:When chatting with a close friend, have you ever wanted to know:Wouldn’t it be cool if you wrote a program that’d just calculate all this stuff for you?Reddit says that it’s “14k points” cool!Your program is going to find similar results and print them for you without those graphs and visuals.“Every great developer you know got there by solving problems they were unqualified to solve until they actually did it.”— Patrick McKenzieThinking along these lines, I believe that:Just dive into the first “Hello, World”-equivalent exercise below. If you can complete it, you’re ready.WhatsApp allows you to export any chat into a text file that looks something like this:So you can write a program that’ll read this chat file, parse it, analyze it, and give you the results.But that’s not enough help, right?“OK, let’s do it then.” 😃When you’re starting out, you don’t want to spend hours setting up your environment. Half of your motivation gets killed right there, right?Repl.it is the way out of this setup frustration.It’s a website that provides an online IDE for almost every language, which you can access for free with just a few clicks. It’s great for small projects like the one we’re building.Every programming book/tutorial ever starts out with a “Hello, World!” program. Why is it so?Apart from being welcoming to newcomers, this program does the job of reassuring the learner that her environment is set up and that things work. So if she does it right, her program will work too.With these goals in mind, here is your “Hello, World!”-equivalent program:Print ""I love you 3000"" 3000 times. (Any Marvel fans out there?)This is a good opportunity to go deep and:If not, then it’s time to do the basics of Python. Don’t worry, it isn’t too difficult.Here onwards, you will build a piece of the project with each chapter.There are 2 files that you will need for the project -Once you have them, this first chapter requires you to open the chat file using your Python program and print all of its contents.This is a good opportunity to go deep and:You know that any editor that you use to open a text file on your computer (Notepad, VS Code, Vim, etc.) is a program, right?You know what? — you can make your own Python program do that. Almost easily!Go through this excellent tutorial by Real Python to learn the concepts of file handling in Python.Count the number of messages you and your friend have exchanged.Then, count each of your individual share — both according to the number of messages and the number of words.Print the results.This is a good opportunity to go deep and:Important things to remember about strings in Python:Caution: Now onward, you will feel your program grow in size and complexity. As it does so, you should start getting conscious about your coding style, and keep the readability of your code in mind.Coding style and readability of code:Brian Kernighan says in his book “The Practice of Programming:”“The purpose of style is to make the code easy to read for yourself and others, and good style is crucial to good programming.”Personally, whenever I try to take decisions about the readability of my code, this line from “The Zen of Python” plays in my brain:“Explicit is better than implicit.”Here are three simple, actionable rules you can keep in mind to develop a good coding style:1. Put some thought into choosing your variables’ namesI find Brian Kernighan’s advice really helpful here:2. Use functions wherever necessaryMore on functions in the next chapter.3. Write helpful commentsIn the end, remember that the principles of programming style are based on common sense guided by experience, not on arbitrary rules and prescriptions.Now, that you’ve calculated your individual share using two metrics — message count and word count — you can use it to calculate each of your average length of messages. Print the results.This is a good opportunity to go deep and:Understand functions as a means to:Duplication may be the root of all evil in software. Functions were one of the first techniques developed to control this evil.It’s easy to understand the syntax of writing functions, but it takes practice and some sense of design to learn when to break the code into functions. One goal is to design functions such that they can be reused when extending your program to new cases.What more? Making such design choices are what makes programming fun.Here are three heuristics from Bob Martin’s book “Clean Code” that’ll guide you while making such choices:When you first write a function, it’ll probably come out long and complicated and not follow any of the above rules. And that’s OK. You can refine and reformat your code later. I don’t think anyone could start with writing functions that follow all the rules mentioned above.Remember these are function-building goals that you need to strive toward. Don’t let them paralyze you.Do you want to resolve the question of who texts first once and for all?  After this milestone, you will.You’ll know exactly how many conversations each of you have initiated and have a list of those first texts. Print all that out.This is a good opportunity to go deep and:Caution: Don’t be intimidated by the docs. They’re your friends.What are modules?Every file of Python source code whose name ends in a .py extension is a module.Python installation comes with a standard library that contains such modules out-of-the-box. These are useful pieces of code you don’t have to write.Now, its time to find out your usual chatting patterns.* What hour of the day do you chat the most? What about the rest of the hours?* Which day of the week do you usually chat the most? What about the rest of the days?* Which month have you chatted the most? What about the rest?Print the results.This is a good opportunity to go deep and:Note: You’ll need the time module again here. It's important for you to know it's OK if you don't remember it; you’re allowed to use Google and check the documentation as many times as you need.Caution: Implementing this can be quite tricky. You’re likely to spend a majority of your coding time banging your head over broken code.Remember: It’s not the computer, but your code that’s at fault.How to debug your code:2. Add print statementsAlthough adding such print statements isn’t the correct way to debug, I find them incredibly effective at times — especially, when I’m working with a text editor like VIM and not on a full-fledged IDE that has a debugger (or when you’re too lazy to learn how to use a debugger.But I have to say, once you learn how to use an IDE debugger, there’s no going back.3. Use an IDE debuggerAs of writing, repl.it doesn’t fully support a debugger yet. My favorite IDEs for Python that do support it are PyCharm and VS Code.A debugger can be so useful that I’ll recommend you make the switch and learn how to use the debugger in it. Trust me, it’s totally worth the pain (especially now that your code is of a considerable complexity.)Personal advice: I using IDE debugger because Python provides a debugger in the standard library module — *pdb** — and I’ll suggest you don't get into using it now.This is a good opportunity to go deep and:Quick intro to RegEx:A regular expression is a special text string for describing a search pattern.You’re probably familiar with wildcard notations, such as *.txt, to find all text files in a file manager. You can think of regular expressions as wildcards on steroids. They allow you to search like:“ I want every string that is between ""http://"" or ""https://"" and the second / after that, if present. Or else, the first /.""Here are a few of my favouite resources to learn RegEx:I’ll let you figure this one out on your own!You must be using some print statements to print the results of each milestone. Now, its time to focus on the presentation of those results. Print all the above results in pretty, neat tables.To do this, you might need to restructure a large portion of the code in order to decouple the print statements from the function definitions (assuming you haven’t already been doing it).This is a good opportunity to go deep and:Quick primer on Python’s rich ecosystem of open-source, third-party packages:Python’s ecosystem has contributors ranging from individual developers to megacorps like Facebook and Google (rich ecosystem, eh?). They offer modules and libraries of code to aid in website construction, numeric programming, game development, data science, machine learning, deep learning, and, well, printing pretty tables.Now, that’s a whole lot of code you don’t have to write.PyPI is the home to all these third-party Python packages. You can find a page on every open-source, third-party package here.Here are a few things that’ll get you up to speed to using PyPI:With this milestone, you’ll be extending your program to a new case — group chats. Up until this point, you would have a direct message chat file with one friend. Now, you’ll modify your program so it’ll work with WhatsApp group-chat files as well.This is a good opportunity to go deep and:It’ll do you well to remember what Brian W. Kerninghan says about good software in his book The Practice of Programming:The basic principles that form the bedrock of good software are simplicity, which keeps programs short and manageable; clarity, which makes sure they are easy to understand, for people as well as machines; generality, which means they work well in a broad range of situations and adapt well as new situations arise; and automation, which lets the machine do the work for us, freeing us from mundane tasks.All right, I hope this has been useful for you. You’ll gain a true understanding of all the mini lessons in this guide once you actually dive into doing the project yourself.Here’s some code to give your start a boost:Don’t be afraid of starting out because things will difficult when you get stuck. That is the adventure; it’ll feel super cool every time you dig yourself out.Also, you can tell me or your fellow learners about your doubts in the Build To Learn Slack group (please feel free to join using the given link).As an ending note, I’d like you to remember the words of Jen Simmons as you work on this project (or any other programming project for that matter):Whatsapp Chat Analyser is one of the 20 cool programming projects that I mentioned in the last post in the series — Build To Learn.

86,Exclusive: Live Facial Recognition Is Coming to U.S. Police Body Cameras,"Wolfcom, a company that makes technology for police, is pitching body cameras with live facial recognition to law enforcement groups across the United States, OneZero has learned. It’s a move that pushes against industry norms: Axon, the largest manufacturer of body cameras in the United States, declared last year that it would not put the invasive technology in its hardware, citing “serious ethical concerns.” NEC, which sells live facial recognition elsewhere in the world, has also not sold it to U.S. law enforcement.Wolfcom claims to have sold body cameras to at least 1,500 police departments, universities, and federal organizations across the country. It has been developing live facial recognition for the Halo, Wolfcom’s newest body camera model, according to documents and a video obtained by OneZero through public records requests.This new initiative makes Wolfcom the first major body camera provider in the United States to pursue live facial recognition, a controversial stance given a nationwide push from privacy advocates to ban the technology.The company originally started as a spy equipment manufacturer and paintball retailer based in Hollywood.“With Realtime Facial Recognition, WOLFCOM hopes to give our friends in Law Enforcement tools that will help them identify if the person they are talking to is a wanted suspect, a missing child or adult, or a person of interest,” Wolfcom founder Peter Austin Onruang wrote in a May 14, 2019, email to the Noble Police Department in Oklahoma.The email also contained a link to a video demonstration of facial recognition already running on a body camera. In the video, three people stand side by side. As they enter the body camera’s field of vision, a nearby computer monitor shows a graphic over the live video, guessing their age, gender, and facial expression and announcing if they are a missing person, have an outstanding warrant, or are wanted for felony assault.In the May 2019 email, Onruang asked police departments to help test the facial recognition software. Other emails obtained by OneZero between Wolfcom and police departments in Los Lunas, New Mexico, and Bakersfield, California, as well as the Hardin County Sheriff’s Department in Ohio, show similar messages sent in May.Wolfcom is now moving forward with beta testing with at least one known police department. A representative with the Los Lunas Police Department told OneZero that it decided on March 4, 2020, to go through with the test and was in the process of installing the software onto an Android phone that would pair with a Wolfcom body camera. Two officers will test the software.In February 2020, Wolfcom posted a password-protected download link for a facial recognition app for use on Android phones. The company’s website now says its Halo camera is “ready for facial recognition.” But it could be in use elsewhere in the country, as the website says the app has been downloaded six times.For now, it seems the beta test is slightly less real-time than the company’s marketing video would suggest. Officers will be able to take a picture with the Halo camera and upload it to the Wolfcom body camera app in the field.“Let’s say a police officer in Arizona two months ago had taken a photo of this guy. It would recognize that and then tell our officer, ‘Hey, you know what? This guy was in Arizona for maybe battery against a police officer,’” Lieutenant Jose Hernandez, of the Los Lunas Police Department, told OneZero. However, it’s not clear which databases the Wolfcom software would be searching or whether it would be able to access information from multiple police departments.Wolfcom didn’t make promises about the facial recognition’s accuracy or say who else would be part of the beta test, according to Hernandez, but the company said participants in the beta program would be able to use the facial recognition service for free in the future.“Say three years from now, if it’s something that gets big and everyone’s using it… we don’t have to pay the thousands of dollars. We would already have access to it for free,” Hernandez said. “We really don’t have to do anything other than just change a cellphone over from an iPhone to an Android phone and upload their app.”Though the beta functionality is limited, Wolfcom has shown off plans to implement its technology with live video feeds as well. Mohamed Thoyyib, Wolfcom’s chief technology officer, shared a demonstration video on Twitter of a next-generation “command center system” that tracked officers in real time and could tap into their body camera video feeds.Wolfcom did not respond to multiple requests for comment. In a February email to the Los Lunas Police Department, the company’s communications specialist said it had no obligation to respond to OneZero’s press inquiries, according to records obtained via a public records request.Wolfcom wasn’t always in the body camera business. The company originally started as a spy equipment manufacturer and paintball retailer based in Hollywood. The company manufactured surveillance products under the name Asianwolf, though the website for that brand no longer exists. “Whether you want to set up a security system using a DVR and cameras, buy a car alarm and accessories for the safety and protection of your vehicle, or make a weekend trip out to a paintball field, Wolfcom is where you will want to go,” a 2008 video on the company’s YouTube page says.Wolfcom is short for “Wolf Commander,” according to the company’s website: “A Wolf is a natural born leader and survivor. Wolves have the ability to work together in a pack or alone. They know how to lead, follow and command. When the leader is killed, another takes his place and so on until the last remaining Wolf.”The company started making body cameras in 2011, but Wolfcom CEO Tiffany Wang told the International Business Times in 2015 that the body cam business took off after Ferguson police killed Michael Brown in 2014.“We started getting calls coming in constantly,” Wang said.Wolfcom’s Hollywood spy shop appears to have shut down around 2015. It had 1.5 stars on Yelp.Today, the company is based in a small, out-of-the way office in Pasadena, California, and claims to have sold more than 1,000,000 body cameras to 1,500 agencies in more than 35 countries. The company has won a smattering of work for the federal government, most regularly with the Department of Defense, earning about $100,000 since 2014.There are still unanswered questions about Wolfcom’s live facial recognition software. The company has made no claims about how accurate its software actually is or what databases it accesses to match suspects. It’s unclear whether the company made the facial recognition algorithm itself or is licensing it from a third party. And as for the beta test, it’s unknown how many police departments have opted in to trial the technology.But what we do know is that Wolfcom is moving forward with the technology anyway.“We are always trying to create tools that would help a police officer assess each individual in real time,” Wolfcom’s facial recognition demo video says.Written by"
87,"I Did a 24-Hour Dopamine Fast and I Felt Everything, Not Nothing","Welcome to Bad Ideas, a column in which we examine the practical limits of technology by considering the things you could do and then investigating exactly why you shouldn’t. Because you can still learn from mistakes you’ll never make.Over the past few months, dopamine fasts have cycled through the wellness media hype cycle. First introduced on Reddit in 2016, then refined and popularized by psychologist and venture capitalist Dr. Cameron Sepah this past summer, the dopamine fast — a practice in which you abstain from certain actions associated with hits of dopamine, the “feel-good neurotransmitter”— was trend-pieced, explained, and seemingly debunked as yet another ill-conceived fad amongst the Silicon Valley elite before the year was out.Though we can’t control the release of chemicals in our brains, we can “fast” on the actions that cause dopamine hits: looking at social media, eating junk food, playing video games, and so on. Take a break, it recommends.And so, the dopamine fast persists. People mock it on Twitter just as much as YouTubers celebrate it. There’s a Reddit community for dopamine fasters to discuss the nuances of their dopamine fasts between their dopamine fasts. There are also a handful of writers who have recounted their experience of doing nothing.I do not subscribe to Silicon Valley’s idea of wellness, which arguably makes me a kind of ideal subject for dopamine fasting. If dopamine fasting truly is hacking your brain chemistry, as the name suggests, then it should work on me regardless of my own biases, right? I decided to give it a shot for 24 hours. At best, I would experience levels of joy I had never known possible. At worst, I’d be bored for a day.Sepah’s guidelines make no specific recommendations for what you should fast from, so to make things as uncomplicated as possible I would fast from just about everything save for simple foods and water. No phone. No computer. No music. No television. No junk food. No human interaction. For 24 hours I would have nothing more than a glass of water, a bowl of oatmeal, a kale salad, and my thoughts. Unlike my previous quest to reach screen time zero, my goal wasn’t to do more with less, but rather to just do less. Just how much stimulation could I avoid, and how would that make me feel?I woke up on the morning of my dopamine fast with a powerful urge to look at my phone. Instead, I just lay there, letting myself feel nothing else but the tension of resisting that urge. Like holding a pose in yoga, I could feel the ways that habits led to imbalances in my mind. I felt both empowered — “Wow, I’ve never really felt this way about my phone before!” — and also suspicious, “Am I really altering my brain chemistry here, or am I just trying to convince myself that I feel different?” Either way, I could tell the dopamine fast was “working” and forcing me to reconsider behaviors I otherwise considered “normal.”Fifteen minutes into my fast, things were genuinely off to a good start.The fundamentals of dopamine fasting, as devised by Sepah, are based on an accepted cognitive behavioral therapy technique known as “stimulus control.” If you feel like you’re trapped within cycles of checking your phone, stress eating, or other kinds of compulsive behavior, dopamine fasting asks that you stop doing those things over a set period of time — as little as one to four hours a day, or as long as a week. By making an intentional choice to not indulge the actions, there’s an opportunity to become more mindful of those compulsory behaviors, and, hopefully, break the cycle of doing something we hate in search of dopamine.Dopamine fasting, however, has a branding problem. Or more accurately, dopamine fasting is branded perfectly for a capitalism-driven wellness industry that demands a procession of new and exciting ways to hack our bodies into health and happiness. “Attach a ‘neuro-’ prefix or a brain chemical to your field of interest, and the world beats a path to your door,” psychiatrist Steven Reidbord wrote in his debunking of dopamine fasting in Psychology Today. “I recently joked that if we recast psychotherapy as ‘verbal neuromodulation,’ the field would enjoy newfound popularity and research funding. This is essentially what the advocates of dopamine fasting did.”For 24 hours I would have nothing more than a glass of water, a bowl of oatmeal, a kale salad and my thoughts.Sepah acknowledges this. “Yes, [the name] helps get clicks and makes it seem cool. My LinkedIn article on the topic has got 125,000 views, so if it helps more people learn about it and practice it, I’m all for it,” he told MEL magazine. “The term is technically incorrect, but ‘stimulus control 101 for dealing with addictive behavior’ just doesn’t have the same ring to it.”It did not help that the subjects of the New York Times profile of the trend, a trio of twentysomething startup founders, hewed closer to the original Reddit-devised dopamine fast — a more ascetic, unscientific version in which you attempt to deprive yourself of feeling any sort of emotion — rather than Sepah’s more informed and controlled approach.Having only seen dopamine fasting within the context of misguided, albeit relatively harmless, tech bros, I was surprised to find that within minutes my own fast seemed to be working. I wasn’t convinced I was hacking my brain into a higher plane of consciousness, but I couldn’t deny that it felt good to spend an entire day devoted to understanding myself a little better.As I got up to make breakfast, I felt a sort of astonished peace — relishing the ability to get lost in my thoughts while simultaneously wondering if I was just deluding myself. I felt equally stupid and enlightened as I marveled at the simplicity of sitting down at my kitchen table and doing nothing else but eating a bowl of oatmeal.I spent the next few hours enjoying the pleasures of just sitting and thinking in silence. I would get up to brush my teeth, or put the dishes away, then sit down and let myself linger — staring off into space, sometimes thinking, and sometimes not thinking. I would feel urges to snack, to open my computer, to kill time making a cup of coffee, and I would sit there and let them pass. Instead of doing things, I would just listen to the ambient noise of my apartment, appreciating the amount of sound that existence produces.By the afternoon it felt like I had flipped my brain into a low-energy mode — processing and registering stimuli but without any real emotional response. It’s not that I was numb to the world, but that I was making a conscious choice to avoid investing too much emotional energy into things. At one point I dropped my keys, but it didn’t elicit the standard flash of mild frustration.Eventually, I stopped feeling urges to do anything. I was riding an emotionless high, looking for new ways to not feel too strongly. I ate my kale salad not out of hunger, but as a defensive mechanism: getting hungry would derail my current state of mind. For one day, I stopped swearing, I stopped judging, I tried to limit my internal monologue to the simplest of observations. “My water bottle is empty, it’s time to refill it.” “I have to put my shoes on if I’m going to go outside.”It was a Panglossian detachment that I had never considered. I wasn’t focused on avoiding things: I was focused on doing nothing.I can’t realistically spend every day avoiding activity. But as much as I hate to admit it, the dopamine fast was the right sort of shake-up I needed. I’m still using my phone, but it’s no longer the first thing I look at when I wake up. I sit with my thoughts a little more instead of drowning them out with more tweets. When I’m feeling stressed or stuck, I afford myself a little break and try to recapture the peace I felt during my fast.I’m aware of how stupid this all sounds. I know how embarrassing it looks to admit that you’re on a dopamine fast. Still, the appeal is clear. We spend most of our days yearning for control over our lives while simultaneously feeling stuck within systems larger than ourselves. It can feel liberating to just tap out.Like choosing to not pick up my phone earlier this morning, I could choose to let this little break untangle the knots of my brain, without making it a part of my identity. I didn’t need to become a Dopamine Faster in order to enjoy its benefits. A silly little Silicon Valley wellness trend was actually leading to my own self-actualization. I was happy but also in disbelief.I think this is what is so baffling to me about dopamine fasting: It works despite the purposefully misleading branding, despite its most visible advocates not doing it right, despite the fact that it’s ultimately in the service of increased productivity. It is nothing more than just taking a break, and yet somehow it still feels like a revelatory experience. “This idea is noble, healthy, and worthwhile, but it’s certainly not a new concept,” writes Harvard physician Peter Grinspoon.Dopamine fasting offers nothing new and something revelatory. Before our devices monetized and quantified every single moment of our working hours, people had plenty of time to sit and be alone with their thoughts. Today, it’s difficult to escape the feedback loops specifically designed to keep us “engaged.” So, I understand the need to call taking a break something else, give it more purpose than just idle time, brand it in a way that fits into the cult of productivity we’ve all been drafted into.It’s not ideal. The worst part of dopamine fasting isn’t the fasting, but rather how performative it can feel. Fasters post about their experience and shape it into a competition. They look at themselves as an RPG character that can be min-maxed into some sort of god-tier build. “Bro, you dopamine fasted for 24 hours? Well, I fasted for a WEEK, and my dopamine receptors are PURGED.”Yet most of us justify taking time off in terms of work. We come back from vacation with so many ideas. We take sick days so we can rest up and get back to work quicker than if we try to suffer through it. The dopamine fast is just a fun-house mirror version of this, a maximal version of rest.Our tech era is trapped in a habit of reinventing things that already exist — and dopamine fasting fits neatly into that narrative. The name sounds like a number of other body-hacking wellness fads like intermittent fasting and digital detoxing. It’s not rest, it’s a period in which we actively avoid compulsive behaviors we don’t like. But in practice, dopamine fasting is refreshingly practical and painfully obvious. All you have to do is convince yourself that you need a break.Written by"
88,How to Do Squats Properly,"For more information on the novel coronavirus and Covid-19, visit cdc.gov.The best way to do a squat is to keep your feet pointed straight in front of you. No, wait — you should point your feet slightly outward. Actually, your feet should be shoulder width apart, or no, they should be slightly wider, or maybe narrower. Squat until your knees hit 90 degrees, then push back up. Or perhaps you should squat as low as you can go.Confused yet? So am I.I’ve been writing about fitness for almost two decades, and over those years, I’ve heard (and, I’ll be honest, written) a lot of conflicting advice about the proper way to do a squat. Let’s try this again, in 2020.A squat would seem like such a basic thing. And yet, ideas about the proper way to perform the exercise “seem to be almost like a religion,” says Silvio Lorenzetti, head of the performance sport section at the Swiss Federal Institute of Sport Magglingen. Although a lot of practices in strength training are now evidence-based, in earlier times, Lorenzetti says, “It was the coach’s opinion that was always right.” A really convincing coach could activate a placebo response among athletes — by creating a strong expectation that this program would get results, the athletes would believe that it did.Practices were built as much on beliefs as on objective evidence, which is why there were multiple schools of thought on what was best. Even today, a lot of fitness advice that’s given is based on the way things have always been done, rather than on scientific evidence.But conflicting advice about squat technique doesn’t always reflect differences in philosophy. In many cases, the variations arise from contrasting definitions and objectives, says Ryan DeBell, founder of Movement Fix, a program that offers workshops and courses for fitness training. “The reason so many people disagree is that they don’t define squatting the same way or fundamentally agree on what they’re trying to do,” he says.The best way to execute a squat depends a lot on what you’re trying to accomplish.Squatting is a natural movement that people around the world do when they’re resting or pooping, and in that case, they might let their knees come together and their butt fall near their ankles. But if you’re doing a squat to try and build leg and back strength, the ideal technique may be a little different. Many instructions for squatting advise against lowering into a position beyond where the knees are bent at 90 degrees, and that might be reasonable advice if the goal is to build leg strength while minimizing strain on the knees, DeBell says.But Kelly Starrett, a coach, physical therapist, bestselling author, and the founder of San Francisco CrossFit and The Ready State (a fitness training program) is more interested in the squat as a functional movement: How do you squat down to pick something up off the ground? He wants to see people squatting in ways that mirror everyday life. Squatting is one of the first movements that children do, Starrett says. “It’s crazy that it is so controversial.”In 2018, Lorenzetti and his colleagues published a study in which they measured how different stances and foot positions affected the three-dimensional kinematics of the squat movement. The researchers measured knee angles, range of motion in the hip and knee joints, and joint movements in the hip, knee, and lower back in 42 volunteers as they performed squats in nine different stances and foot positions — ranging from feet close together and toes pointed straight ahead to feet wide apart and rotated 42 degrees outward. Half of the participants were novice squatters, and half were experienced at the exercise.The results showed that the foot position and the distance between the feet had a big influence on the force loading and motion on the knee and hip. “In the more extreme positions, it’s more difficult to maintain proper leg alignment,” Lorenzetti says. He defines proper leg alignment as when the hip, knee, and feet are aligned in a single two-dimensional plane.“If you have a problem squatting like that, you’ve never taken a poop in the woods. We’ve created a whole set of arbitrary rules for something that looks good on Instagram.”Lorenzetti’s research shows that standing with the feet either very narrow or very wide has the potential to strain the body in ways that could cause injury, so he recommends that beginners avoid these stances.Yet some advice purported to protect against injury isn’t well supported. For instance, I have often heard fitness trainers say that the knee should never move forward beyond the toes during a squat, but Lorenzetti says his research shows that this advice is nonsense. “For most people, it’s safer and smarter to have a natural forward shift of knee,” he says. The rule about not moving the knee beyond the toe comes from a study of three powerlifters in the 1970s. One of the athletes in the study exhibited the greatest sheer force in the knee when it extended the furthest forward, and so the researcher concluded that it was the forward movement that was responsible for that extra force, Lorenzetti says. But that conclusion was based on a single example that doesn’t generalize to the wider population.A University of Memphis study that examined knee position during barbell squats concluded that “although restricting forward movement of the knees may minimize stress on the knees, it is likely that forces are inappropriately transferred to the hips and low-back region,” and so it may be safer to allow the knees to move slightly past the toes.The oft-cited notion that it’s dangerous to squat beyond the point where your thighs are parallel to the ground is also ridiculous, Starrett says. “If you have a problem squatting like that, you’ve never taken a poop in the woods. We’ve created a whole set of arbitrary rules for something that looks good on Instagram.” People should be able to squat “ass to ankle,” he says.Still, human anatomy has some natural variability. The angle and length of the femur’s neck, the hip socket’s orientation, and the depth of the hip socket are just a few factors that can influence someone’s range of motion in the hips during a squat, and these anatomical differences mean there is no one-size-fits-all squat position, DeBell says.So, what’s the bottom line here? How do I avoid giving more bad advice? In 2020, most experts seem to agree on a few basic principles: Keep your torso as upright as possible (rather than leaning forward and bending at the waist), your knees aligned with your toes, and your feet firm on the ground with your weight as evenly distributed as possible. “Your foot pressure shouldn’t change through the whole squat,” Starrett says.The precise position of your feet is not the most crucial thing. What’s more important, Lorenzetti says, is that you get used to doing squats in the first place — with your feet placed in a way that feels comfortable. DeBell agrees, saying that if you use the stance that feels the most natural and gives you the greatest depth, there’s really no mechanical reason to think you’d have bad form that would strain your joints in a way that would lead to injury.Squatting is very safe if you compare it to other fitness activities, Lorenzetti says. What’s really dangerous to your health is being sedentary — in other words, not squatting.Written by"
89,The Secret Lives of Democratic Women Married to MAGA Men,"Days before the 2018 midterm elections, a woman named Lisa was driving on a remote road in sun-baked Eastern Washington. An area that encompasses all of the state East of the Cascade Range — which is to say, most of the state — Eastern Washington over the past decade has been home to several unsuccessful movements to secede from liberal Seattle and the Pacific Coast to become the 51st U.S. state.Not surprisingly, it is ruby red Trump country.On this particular day, Lisa was listening to the live call-in radio show I host weekday afternoons on SiriusXM. We were talking about politics but also about a topic that would soon emerge as a recurring theme on the show: the divide inside marriages that Donald Trump and his presidency had created. A woman was on the line from her kitchen in rural Michigan, recounting her struggles as a progressive Democrat married to a Trump supporter.Lisa, a college-educated white professional in her forties, painfully related to what she heard. She pulled over to the side of the road and phoned in.“Wow, I’m not even sure what to say,” Lisa began. “This hit so much home. I almost wanted to cry.”It was an early instance of what would, over the next year, become a surprising — and strong — community of Democrats married to Trump supporters reaching out to each other through my satellite radio show on SiriusXM’s Progress channel. (All callers to the radio program use only their first names and locations, and I am using that convention for the women I spoke with by phone or through Facebook, too, so they could feel free to discuss sensitive marital matters.)Lisa’s husband, a farmer from a family that had been in the business for generations, told her he was a registered Democrat when they first met. “Back then, six years ago, we didn’t talk about politics because it really wasn’t part of our relationship at that time,” Lisa told the listeners. “Then, when we went through the election, I voted for Hillary Clinton and he voted for Trump. And our relationship has been on the rocks ever since.”I can’t count how many people affected by the 2016 election have called my show day after day. Before and after the election, these callers recounted tensions with parents, children, extended family, co-workers, neighbors, and friends who are Trump supporters.But it wasn’t until the very jittery days before the 2018 midterms, in the wake of the horrific October 27th mass shooting in Pittsburgh at the Tree Of Life synagogue, that the plight of women (and some men) in marriages or intimate relationships with Trump supporters began to surface regularly on my program.Noting how isolated she felt, Lisa told listeners: “My neighbors are all Trump supporters, too.”Yet on the call-in show, connecting to a woman 2,000 miles away from the side of the road, that isolation started to lift. Today my show has a regular segment featuring their voices, their stories, and their efforts to negotiate life in the political minority, whether in their families or communities. The women connect on my show’s Facebook page, as well, reaching out to each other and to me directly.White men have been the core of Trump’s support, and stories about them often imply a certain level of family political cohesiveness. Yet detailed analyses of the 2016 election show a far lower percentage of women than men voted for Trump in 2016. And both the 2018 midterm election results and other recent data show that women, both college and non-college educated, have only moved further toward Democrats. We rarely, if ever, hear discussion of the distraught women navigating tense relationships with these men.The women I’ve heard from often not only have partners who demean them for their political beliefs and choices; they face hostility from other family members, including their own children. Some have ended their relationships or are headed in that direction. Others try to make it work, either because the couples have a strong bond despite the tensions or, sadly, because they believe they have little financial choice but to stay.These are their stories.The first call came two days after the Pittsburgh massacre. The caller was Alison from Los Angeles. Her challenge: co-parenting her twin four-year-old girls with a devoted Trump supporter she’d once been engaged to, but who she eventually realized she couldn’t possibly marry.I’d been talking about how the synagogue shooter who murdered 11 people had promoted racist conspiracy theories online about “invaders” in migrant “caravans” — migrants Trump had been targeting as “invaders” as well, using white supremacist terminology — and blamed Jews for helping the “invaders.” I’d offered up my own strong opinions on the dangers of the cult of Trump, as well.“I’m Jewish and he’s Jewish and we were talking today after the shooting and he says, ‘Trump can’t be held responsible — it’s not his fault,’” Alison said, referring to her ex-fiancé. “Then he turns it around to, ‘Well, we have the best economy’” and he “goes back to ‘Crooked Hillary.’”A 39-year-old career counselor and therapist with a master’s degree, she’d met her former fiancé, a successful businessman, in 2009 on JDate. He was a “charmer,” she said — “sweet, funny, tall, successful in his own right” — who initially treated her “like a queen.”In 2012 they became engaged and were living together but set no wedding date. They began fertility treatments, and Alison gave birth in 2014. During her pregnancy she learned one of the twins had a metabolic condition. That’s when health care became a major issue for Alison.“I didn’t pay attention to his politics,” she said of the time long before the election, noting he didn’t discuss political issues. She said he only registered to vote for the first time — at the age of 38 — a few months before the election, just to vote for Trump.“He has this one photograph where his dad was at a party with Donald Trump, from the ’80s, in New York,” Alison said in describing what, at least in part, drew her former fiancé to Trump. He “liked Trump as a celebrity,” she said, and he “watched ‘The Apprentice.’”“He would call me a ‘libtard.’ He was never like that before.”The day following the election, “on his Facebook page, he posted that picture of his dad with Trump,” she said. “I was devastated.”They separated and tried, unsuccessfully, to reconcile several times. As Trump took office, they argued intensely about the president’s actions, especially Trump’s assaults on Obamacare. Alison couldn’t fathom how he didn’t see the threat to the health of his own daughter, who had a pre-existing condition.“I saw [his] language change, even towards me,” she said. “He would call me a ‘libtard.’ He was never like that before. I didn’t see racism in him [before], and homophobia, but I saw it afterward.”She still sees him regularly because of the girls. He lauds Trump’s support of Israel, Alison said, but when her synagogue was recently vandalized in an anti-Semitic hate crime he refused to speak with her about how Trump emboldens white supremacists.And when she dressed the twins in t-shirts that say, “She won” — because the girls saw Alison wearing one and wanted their own — he threatened to put MAGA hats on them (something Alison vowed will never happen). She’s aware the incident is likely just a taste of battles to come as the girls grow up.Alison’s call inspired many others in the days and months that followed. Some turned to social media to connect further with one another. Others reached out to me privately online.“I am afraid there are many of us out here with Trump-supporting husbands and living in deeply conservative communities,” Lynnette from South Dakota wrote on my show’s Facebook page in response to Alison’s call. Mary from Florida posted: “It’s so depressing to have to live like this.” Cindi from Minnesota explained how she got divorced months after the election, ending her six-year marriage, and hasn’t looked back.“We are not alone!” Erica from Wisconsin exclaimed on the Facebook thread, suggesting a private Facebook group, as did several others. They created a new private group and also started conversations on other ones they were already active in.Male listeners with Trump-supporting wives also posted on the thread: Jeff from Florida, Todd from Arkansas. But the men are in the minority. Unlike the diverse group of overall callers to the show, most of these particular calls and social media comments have come from white women married to white men, though some also come from women of color married to white men. Angela from Los Angeles, an African American woman married for 20 years to a white man, called in to say that dialogue with her Trump-supporting husband had completely broken down: “We can’t even talk in our home about race or politics — It’s gotten that deep!”“Trump came into his world and I don’t know my son anymore. This has disrupted my whole house.”The one thing the women share most of all is the feeling of being under siege.“Just two minutes before those calls came in, I sat here and was berated, told I was crazy,” Joanne, the woman from rural Michigan, said when she called in last year, referring to the calls from other women married to Trump backers.Now, speaking from her kitchen while cooking and listening to the show via her phone app and headset, she detailed how her husband and 22-year-old son “don’t see anything wrong with the comments about grabbing women by the genitals — and say, ‘oh it’s just funny, he’s joking.’”Joanne said her son, who’d ardently supported Barack Obama as a teen, had been transformed. “Trump came into his world,” she said. “And I don’t know my son anymore. This has disrupted my whole house.”In an interview this fall, Joanne told me that both she and her husband, both 49, are lifelong Democrats from union families. Her grandmother “worked for the Teamsters [Union],” and knew the late, legendary Teamster president, Jimmy Hoffa.“My dad has been a Teamster his whole life and I was raised in a pro-union Teamster home by hippies — pot-smoking hippies,” she said with a laugh.Her husband is a member of the United Auto Workers union, as was his father. Joanne and her husband lived for over 25 years in Macomb County, the cluster of suburbs north of Detroit often cited by pollsters as one of the most important bellwether counties in the country. The county supported Obama twice before turning to Trump in 2016.Then they moved to rural Michigan in 2016 and supported Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary. His loss left a sour taste in their mouths. “I feel like I held my nose and voted for Clinton because I knew how dangerous Trump was,” she said.Her husband voted for Clinton too, but later regretted it. He came to support many of Trump’s policies and ideas, she said, including on immigration, often lauding Trump and belittling Joanne’s concerns. Though he now threatens to vote for Trump in 2020, Joanne doesn’t think he will — not if she keeps working on him.In looking at the 2020 candidates, Joanne said her husband favors Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. They’re both “not too fond of Biden” and are “worried that the same thing that happened with Hillary is going to happen with Biden, where the DNC is going to ignore the primary vote and force Grandpa Joe on us.”That’s a scenario she doesn’t want to think about because then all bets are off regarding her husband’s vote.“I’m just hoping that once Trump is gone, everything goes back to normal,” she said.For other women who’ve connected with the show, even such mild hope is out of reach. For some, the Trump era’s trickle-down political divisions have led to the death of love.Angela, a listener from western Michigan, met her boyfriend on Tinder in May of 2016, when she was 34 and he was 37. They “bonded over college football,” she said in an interview, and had a great time together. The relationship became serious quickly, and they introduced one another to their families. Angela’s boyfriend didn’t talk much about politics but did talk about “not supporting Clinton,” she said. And he voted for Trump.“He never voted before and thought it would be funny to see Trump as president,” she explained. Like almost everyone, they both thought Clinton would win.“My birthday is November 9,” she’d written on my show’s Facebook page. “I woke up [that morning after election night in 2016] to my boyfriend excited, telling me Trump won, knowing it would devastate me. Completely ruined my birthday.”In March of 2017 she ended the relationship.“Over time I would see his racism, his misogyny, slip out,” she told me. There were red flags in the past, she realized; now it all became more evident.Cindi, a listener from Minnesota who joined some of the women in online discussions to tell them about her divorce, said in an interview that she, too, had previously noticed bigotry in her husband of six years. But in the Trump era it metastasized.“He absolutely hated Hillary, but when I would ask him why, he could never give me a legitimate answer,” she said. “He seemed to dislike smart women who have some kind of power.”A Native American who is a member of a tribe in Minnesota, Cindi is also an attorney. Her husband began “not only saying horrible things about my profession, but about my heritage as well,” she said.After the election, his family visited from southwestern Wisconsin for Thanksgiving. Though she made it clear she didn’t want politics discussed, she felt ambushed by him and four of his relatives, all Trump supporters.“I felt like I was talking to a bunch of aliens!” she exclaimed, noting it was “the last straw.” She left him, and by early 2017 their divorce was final.After 15 years of marriage, Christy, who called into the show this past August from Columbus, Ohio, left her Republican husband as well. “He was just becoming more and more racist,” she said of the months after the election. “He got worse and I didn’t want my daughter around that.”Christy described herself as the “breadwinner” and said leaving her husband wasn’t an economic challenge. Sue from Cleveland isn’t as fortunate: Because of her financial situation, she’s had to create a long-term strategy for leaving her Trump-supporting husband. She called the show late last year, explaining that she was 65, retired, and on Medicare and Social Security.“He told me that he thought that the military should just mow all the people down as they came to the border.”Sue said she’s always been a feminist, was an officer in a prominent women’s organization, and that her husband of 30 years “seemed to be totally cool with that.” But he’s radically shifted his political views over years of watching Fox News. “When I walk in the room, Fox goes off, and when he walks in the room CNN goes off,” she explained. “And that’s kind of what we do for each other.”A shocking comment from her husband threw the untenable situation into relief.“We were in a Mexican restaurant and, as we were eating, he told me that he thought that the military should just mow all the people down as they came to the border,” she said. Sue expressed outrage, but she said it was clear that he “enjoyed saying it.”Sue enrolled in school for retraining so that she could come out of retirement, get a job and, when the time is right, break the news to him that she’s leaving.“I didn’t expect to be in this position, but I won’t spend the last years of my life surrounded by hate,” she said.While some of the women leave their husbands, others make a go of it, explaining that the connection they have with their husbands is stronger than their political differences. Still others say they want to leave, but don’t think they can do it and so have found a way of coping.Andrea, who lives in the small city of Ottumwa, in southeastern Iowa, goes on the offensive against her husband, a former military intelligence officer.“I try not to pick fights with him, but if Trump has done something extra-stupid I will lay into him,” she told me after reaching out recently on Twitter, describing herself as the “aggressor” in these exchanges.Andrea is 48 and married for 11 years, in a second marriage. She was a Republican from the time she was 18 and had always voted GOP, as did her first husband. But she went back to school a few years ago, got her BA and, as she put it, “my mind opened wide!”She became a Democrat in 2015, caucused for Sanders in 2016, and voted for Clinton in the general election. She plans to caucus for Warren in 2020.“You suck it up and grit your teeth and every once in a while absolutely blow a gasket.”A few months back, Andrea had her bags packed, “ready to walk out the door.” He “begged me to stay,” she explained. “We can have a good time together as long as we are not talking politics.” And when she does feel compelled to raise it, she said, “I can counterpunch anything he throws my way.”Rae Ann, a suburban Ohio homemaker, told me after reaching out to me on Facebook: “If it were just me, I’d have thrown in the towel long ago.” But she has a daughter and a mother to care for, she explained, and believes she doesn’t have the skills to get a job.“You suck it up and grit your teeth and every once in a while absolutely blow a gasket and accuse him of being racist,” she said. “It’s fairly miserable.”Listening to women with similar experiences has been a lifeline for her and others. And hearing me vigorously doing battle with Trump supporters who call in at least once per show — most of them angry men who hurl insults — helps too.“You’ve given me some ammo to use at home,” Joanne from Michigan told me. “When you get all riled up and start yelling back at them, I just love it. It sure does make the day so much better. It gives me relief and gratification. I live for those moments.”And in the Trump era, as these women face hostility at home while working hard to change the political reality in 2020, living for the moment goes a long way.Written by"
90,How to Build More Muscle With Less Work and Less Fatigue,"There’s now a growing consensus among exercise scientists that total training volume is the main driver of muscle growth. If you want to build bigger muscles, you need to spend time in the gym, and the number one thing you can do to get better results is probably just train more often.However, this shouldn’t be seen as supporting the sort of fitness nihilism that says nothing other than sheer effort matters and that there’s no way to make your workouts easier without sacrificing results. Volume is the primary factor underlying muscle growth — but not the only factor.In fact, there are quite a few ways you can train smarter, getting better results with the same amount of time in the gym, if not less.Just as importantly, you can build more muscle while suffering less fatigue for your efforts.Here are five ways to do just that, explained.Popular wisdom holds you should perform sets of 4-6 reps for strength, 8-12 reps for hypertrophy, and 15+ reps for endurance. Popular wisdom is wrong.For starters, let’s consider the nature of those three criteria: Strength and endurance are performance-based metrics, while muscular hypertrophy (growth, in plain English) is a morphological characteristic. So hypertrophy doesn’t really fit in with strength and endurance.In fact, a multitude of studies have found low-rep sets build just as much muscle as sets of 8-12 reps — sometimes even more. This shouldn’t be terribly surprising; after all, there’s obviously a fairly strong correlation between being strong and having big muscles.But what about strength and endurance? Common sense dictates that lifting heavy should build more strength, and lifting for high reps should be ideal for endurance. After all, lifting heavy is literally what strength is, and maintaining physical exertion for a longer period of time is literally what endurance is.That isn’t necessarily the case, however. Amazingly, some people build more muscle mass — and yes, even more maximal strength — on high-rep sets.In what might be the most underappreciated resistance training study of all time, 16 college rugby players were tested on four different workouts: a powerlifting-style workout with heavy weights and low reps, a bodybuilding-style workout with moderate weight and reps, an endurance-style workout with low weight and high reps, and a power-style workout with low weight and low reps (but high velocities).After each workout, the researchers tested the athlete’s testosterone/cortisol ratio, which is considered to be the most reliable biomarker for recovery from exercise. The subjects varied in terms of which workout gave them the highest and which gave them the lowest T/C ratio.For each athlete, the workout after which they had the highest T/C ratio was labeled their “best” protocol, and the one after which they had the lowest T/C ratio was labeled their “worst” protocol. Following this, half the athletes were put on their best protocol for eight weeks, and half on their worst protocol for eight weeks. Then after a three-week break, the two groups switched, so each subject spent eight weeks on both his best and worst protocol.The results contradicted one of the core assumptions of modern exercise science: Every single subject gained strength and mass on their best protocol, even if it was the endurance or power workout. Twelve of the 16 either made no progress, or even lost strength on their worst protocol, even if their worst was the strength workout.The researchers continued to test the T/C ratio throughout the experiment, and found that 12 of 16 subjects showed consistent responses; the ones with inconsistent responses were the ones who gained strength on their worst protocol. That supports a person’s best and worst protocol are, indeed, consistent, rather than being artifacts of random chance.The upshot of all this is many people can build more strength by lifting light weights than by lifting heavy weights.Incidentally, volume wasn’t equated between groups. The power workout had the lowest training volume and the endurance workout the highest; some people also do better with more or less volume than others.Of course, the researchers in this study did a whole lot of blood work to identify the best and worst protocols. So how can you do this on your own?Remember the T/C ratio is a measure of your recovery status. In the absence of blood work, you can simply take note of how hard it is for you to recover from a given workout by a) measuring how well your strength and endurance have recovered/improved two days later when you do your next workout, and b) taking note of how tired a given workout makes you both immediately afterward and a few hours later.Note that I’m talking about tiredness, not soreness; soreness isn’t a good indication of recovery status.Without blood work, you’ll want to test each protocol 2-3 times, rather than just once like they did in the study. But over time, you should be able to figure out which training style invigorates you and which one kicks your butt.Note that this totally contradicts that common “broscience,” which says that being sore and tired is the sign you had a good workout. This study suggests that, in fact, fatigue is at best a necessary evil and at worst a sign you’re doing the wrong kind of workout for your body. More training volume with less fatigue should be the goal.A cluster set is a set that’s broken down into several minisets, with short intraset rest periods between them. The weight is reracked or put down during these short rest periods, allowing the muscles a brief respite before the next miniset.For instance, you might perform three reps, rerack the weight, rest 20 seconds, grab the weight and do three more reps, rerack and rest 20 seconds, and then pick up the weight and do two more reps before ending the cluster set. After that, you’d take a much longer rest — at least three minutes and sometimes more than five — before doing the next cluster set.So why do people do sets this way? Because it lets them do more reps at a given weight. In the above example, eight reps were performed, but because of the intraset rest periods, you could use a weight that’s around your four- or five-rep max and instead do eight reps with it.The preponderance of scientific evidence now suggests total training volume is the main driver of muscle growth. The more you lift, the more you’ll grow, at least up to the point where you start to have trouble recovering from your workouts. There’s such a thing as too much training volume, but in practice, that’s rarely a problem unless you’re truly hardcore about your training — and even then, it shouldn’t be a problem if you’re doing your best protocol, as described above.Total training volume seems to have a less consistent benefit for strength than for hypertrophy. For strength, lifting heavy is more important than lifting a lot (for most people, anyway), but you do need to at least hit a certain minimum level of volume.However, there’s another factor at play regarding strength and power: skill training. Each exercise is its own skill, in the sense you can get better at it by practicing that specific movement. Cluster sets help you get more skill practicing a certain movement by doing more reps at very high intensities. At least one study shows cluster sets help you gain more strength and power without compromising hypertrophy but don’t necessarily increase hypertrophy compared to traditional straight sets.All of which is to say cluster sets are likely to help with strength more than hypertrophy and are more likely to be helpful if you’ve determined lifting heavy is the best training modality for you.You can perform cluster sets with higher rep ranges, like three subsets of six at a weight you could do ten reps with. However, in this case, you’ll want to keep the intraset rest periods shorter, like 5-10 seconds.As a final note, cluster sets may be less fatiguing than straight sets, even when work volume is higher. In one study, cluster sets produced less of a cortisol response than straight sets, indicating faster recovery.Cluster sets are also great for unilateral movements — those where you work only one side of your body at a time, like one-legged leg curls. You can alternate sides, lifting with one limb while the other one rests.They also tend to be ideal for barbell exercises like the bench press. Note, however, that muscle failure can sneak up on you with cluster sets, so it’s good to have a spotter if you lift heavy barbells cluster-style. Using accommodating resistance — described in the next section — does make this safer since it makes it easier to rerack the weight without getting trapped under the bar in bench presses and squats.Accommodating resistance is a set of techniques for modifying the resistance (that is, the weight) of an exercise such that the resistance curve of the exercise matches your body’s strength curve for that exercise.That probably didn’t make sense to you, but I’ll explain. With many exercises, the actual amount of resistance varies at different points of the exercise. With a barbell curl, for instance, you’re lifting the weight almost horizontally near the bottom and top and straight up near the middle of the exercise — thus the resistance is highest at the midpoint of the exercise.Compare that to a squat or bench press, where the resistance is about the same throughout the movement since the weight goes straight up and down, at the same angle the whole way through.This is the exercise’s resistance curve.The strength curve of an exercise refers to how strong the active muscle groups are at various points of the exercise. Muscles are strongest around the midpoint of their active range of motion. Your bicep and tricep, for instance, are at their strongest when your elbow is about half bent.This is why the hardest part of the bench press is the bottom of the movement, when the bar is on your chest: The weight is the same throughout, but you’re weakest at the bottom. Near the top, your pectoral muscle gets weaker again, but the shoulders and arms are more able to help than they were at the bottom.By the same token, pull-ups and chin-ups are hardest near the top because the involved muscles reach the ends of their range of motion. That’s why people can often get 80% of the way up fairly easily yet not get their chin over the bar.This is the exercise’s strength curve.The reason many exercises have sticking points, like the bottom of the bench press, is because the strength and resistance curves don’t match. Accommodating resistance alters the resistance curve to match the strength curve.There are several ways to apply accommodating resistance to an exercise.First, you can attach elastic bands to the weight you’re lifting. This is most commonly done with barbell bench presses and squats using a pair of identical elastic bands, one attached to either end of the barbell. The lifting of the weight stretches the bands, causing the resistance to increase as the barbell goes up.This video shows how to attach the bands for a bench press, and this video shows how to do it with squats. You can also use just a single band for the bench press as shown in this video; that isn’t possible for squats, though.As a general rule, you should aim to replace 30-40% of the total weight with band resistance — so if you squat 155 pounds, you should instead squat something like 95 pounds plus a pair of bands that each add 25-30 pounds of resistance.Note that because the resistance provided by the bands varies throughout the exercise, all bands will be labeled with a range, like 10-35 pounds of resistance. Base your calculations on the highest resistance the bands will provide. Since you won’t usually stretch them all the way, this will usually be a bit lower than the highest number listed — i.e., a 10-35–pound band may actually provide a maximum 20 pounds on the bench press and 30 pounds on the squat. Your calculations won’t be totally exact, but they don’t need to be.As an added bonus, the use of bands makes squats and bench presses safer, since eliminating the sticking point means you’re not likely to get trapped under the bar. That makes them a great safety practice for those who lift without a spotter.Note, however, that the bands do change the angle of the exercise somewhat, which means the muscles are worked in a slightly different way, and your technique has to adjust accordingly.You can achieve the same effect by attaching chains to the ends of the barbell. At the bottom of the movement, most of the chain rests on the floor, and as it lifts, more of the chain is lifted into the air, increasing the weight.Chains are expensive, heavy, and loud. Unlike bands, you can’t travel with them. The advantage of chains is they hang straight down so they don’t change the angle as a band would. This makes chains desirable for competitive weightlifters who are actually squatting to get better at squatting; the rest of us should stick to bands.Somewhat counter-intuitively, you can get stronger and lift heavier weights by selectively weakening your muscles.Most of your skeletal muscles are arranged in pairs that act in opposition to each other. The hamstring bends your knee, while the quadriceps strengthens it. Your triceps and pectoral muscles push your arms forward, while your back and biceps pull things toward you.In exercise science, the muscles used to power an exercise are called the agonists for that exercise, while the muscles opposing them are the antagonists.Even when you’re not consciously activating them, the antagonist muscles still exert some force. As such, you can temporarily increase your strength on a given exercise by prefatiguing the antagonist muscles of that exercise.The way this looks in practice is you superset two opposing exercises — movements that move the same body part in opposite directions — by doing one immediately after the other. For example:Although you might expect the short rest period to make you more tired, fatigue mostly occurs on the level of the individual muscle. In fact, when you perform a set of bench presses right before a set of seated rows, back and bicep activity increases and you can perform more sets of the seated row than you would otherwise.The order in which you perform the two exercises seems to matter — in one study, bench pressing before rowing worked better than rowing before bench pressing. In another, doing leg curls before leg extensions produced greater performance increases than the other way around.The takeaway here seems to be that the more fast twitch-dominant muscle group should be worked first. In general, this means that for upper-body supersets, the pushing motion should precede the pulling motion. Lower-body supersets, hamstring exercises, or those which bend the knee and/or extend the back should precede quadriceps-dominant exercises or those which straighten the knee.A few examples:It’s vitally important the rest interval between the first and second set be kept short, as the benefits of agonist-antagonist supersets start to disappear when the rest period is over one minute. In general, 30 seconds is a good guideline.As an added benefit, even though you do more work, this style of training actually decreases perceived exertion.No, not car-safety laws. Autoregulation is a class of workout programming techniques that aim to dynamically adjust the amount of training load produced in order to allow a trainee to train exactly the right amount — not so hard as to excessively fatigue themselves but not undertraining so they leave progress on the table.Now, many people try to do this by “listening to their body,” taking it easy when they feel tired and pushing themselves harder when they have the energy. That’s not what autoregulation is.There are two shortcomings to the “listen to your body” approach. First, it’s subjective. Second, how tired you feel is mostly related to your central nervous system, whereas training fatigue occurs mainly at the local level, within the individual muscles. Thus, your energy level doesn’t particularly measure how strong you are.Instead, autoregulation techniques estimate recovery status based on how you perform during your workout, after you’ve started it. This requires you to be recording your workouts — not on video but, rather, writing down how many sets and reps you do of each exercise.One example of an autoregulation method is reactive deloading. In this method, developed by trainer Menno Henselmans, any time you backslide on an exercise — perform fewer reps at a given weight than you did in your last training session — you lower the weight and perform your remaining sets power-style, at high velocities.For example, suppose in your last training session you performed four sets of dumbbell presses with 50-pound dumbbells, and your rep counts were 5, 5, 4, 4. In your current workout, you do five reps on the first set — but only four on the second set.In this case, you’d use 30-35–pound dumbbells for the remaining two sets. You’d lift the weights as fast as possible, but you’d still only do five reps per set, even though you could do more with the lighter weights.This style of speed work allows you to get a decent workout, work on your technique, and still make some progress — with relatively little fatigue.Another approach for autoregulation is based on weekly training volume. Any time you have a bad workout overall — one in which you progressed on less than a third of your exercises — you could take an extra rest day before your next workout.There are several other ways to implement autoregulation, but it’s a complicated enough subject to merit its own article. Suffice to say autoregulation is always a) objective,and b) dynamic.In research, autoregulated training programs usually outperform programs that follow a fixed progression. However, this may only be true in more dedicated trainees — it’s conceivable an unmotivated trainee could use autoregulation as an excuse to slack off.Note also that most approaches to autoregulation, like the two mentioned here, presuppose your baseline training schedule errs on the side of training too much rather than too little. If you were undertraining, reducing your workload in response to a lack of progress would be the exact opposite of what you’d want to do.It has now become a cliche to say “work smarter, not harder,” but there’s no need to choose between the two. You can combine these techniques and strategies with a higher training volume to build more muscle if you want.Then again, you can absolutely choose to take the 80/20 approach, cut back your time in the gym a little bit, apply the advice in this article, and get good results with less time, effort, and hardship. Both approaches are equally valid, and it’s just a matter of what your goals are.If you take one thing away from this article, it should be this: You should work with your body and design programs based on your individual needs, capabilities, and recovery capacity. However, this isn’t a subjective choice and can’t be based on intuition alone — it should be based on sound principle of exercise science and objective measurements of your performance with various training programs.Written by"
91,The One-Sided Marriage,"My husband, Yasushi, hasn’t spoken to me in a whole year. Not a nod or even a grunt. All I get are silent stares, stiff postures, and a clamped mouth.I tried everything to squeeze words out of him.Like begging.“Please.” I hugged Yasushi’s leather shoe. “Just say one word — just one. About today’s baseball match. About your paperwork in the office. Anything.”Failing that, I tried seduction.“How about you take the day off tomorrow?” On the bed, wearing my fishnet stockings, I stroked Yasushi’s boxers. “So I can ‘work’ on you the whole night?” I giggled.When none of that yielded any results, I relied on threats.“Look, if you don’t say something, I’ll go to my parents’ house and stay there forever.”From the kitchen table, Yasushi stared at me with his large glassy eyes and a frozen thick-lipped frown.“And I’ll take your PlayStation 4 with me!”More watching and scowling.“And those dirty magazines I found under the sofa.”Nothing.I threw a pillow at him and stormed out of the living room. I had a short temper, but I hated fights. I preferred discussions. However, I couldn’t fix a communication problem with no communication.So, I decided to seek professional help. A quick internet search led me to Tokyo Counseling Services, a team specialized in helping marriages thrive through reconciliation or separation. Honestly, couples therapy had never made sense to me. Why keep riding on a boat just to patch its holes?But sometimes you love a boat so much, you stay in it even while knowing it could sink. So much, you’d do everything you can to keep it afloat, sailing through the oceans.“Your husband hasn’t spoken to you for a year?” Dr. Takahashi blurted, gawking at me with her round eyes.“Or been intimate with me.”“I see.” Dr. Takahashi squinted as if I were too bright to look at. “But Mrs. Mizushima…”“Yes?” I said.“I don’t want to be rude, but marriage counseling only works when the two parties are present.”“Well…” I glanced at the vacant space next to me on the couch. “If I could talk my husband into coming here, I wouldn’t need the therapy.”“But I don’t think — ”“I don’t need you to think,” I yelled. “I need you to help me!”“May I recommend a group class to deal with your anger?”“I don’t need stupid anger management!”“Remember, Mrs. Mizushima,” Dr. Takahashi said, dropping her pen onto her glistening notepad. “We only shout when our arguments aren’t loud enough.”I sighed. “Sorry, I’ll be quieter.”Dr. Takahashi examined my face, finally picking up her pen. “Okay, let’s start from the beginning.”An awkward silence followed. I hated silence.“So…” She jotted down words again. “Why do you think your husband stopped talking to you?”“I’ve been asking myself that question for the last 365 days.”“Any theories?”“I can’t think of any,” I confessed. “I didn’t get on his nerves or cheat on him. Plus, the sex was terrific.”“Sometimes satisfaction is one-sided…”“You mean, I wasn’t actually good in bed?”“I mean, maybe you’re the only one who thinks the relationship’s fine.”I fiddled with my wedding ring, reviewing the shortcomings of my marriage. “We like to sleep together, but not literally sleep together. No matter what we do, we always wake up tangled up with each other’s limbs and sore.”Dr. Takahashi laughed. “So cute. I don’t think it bothers your husband.”“Another problem is I always misplace Yasushi’s things when I’m cleaning. Like his clothes, his watch — one time I even misplaced his glasses. I have a very bad memory.”“Does he mind?”I shook my head. “He finds it entertaining. Pretends it’s a treasure hunt.”Dr. Takahashi held her thumb to her triangular chin. “Your marriage seems perfect — I think we need to think about it some more.”“If spoken words don’t work,” Dr. Takahashi told me in one of our sessions. “Why not try written ones?”And so, while Yasushi wasn’t at home, I composed a letter. Initially, I thought of text messaging him, but I wanted to be more personal.Dear Yasushi,Have you noticed that you haven’t talked or made love to me in a year? I miss it. I miss hearing your husky voice, feeling your plump lips against mine, caressing your chiseled abs (okay, I haven’t seen them since you stopped jogging, but I suspect they’re still there, under that beer belly of yours).I also miss how you used to wake me up by whispering into my ear, cook your awful spaghetti for me, make me feel heard, appreciated, understood.In other words — or rather the same — I miss you. I miss my friend, my lover, my husband. So, could you bring him back home?Please?After unintentionally signing the letter with a couple of tears, I walked to the refrigerator and held it there with a magnet.It stayed there for a day.Then a week.When a month had passed, I grabbed the letter and set it on fire over the toilet. Once it was converted into black ashes, I flushed it down. Together with my hopes.“Come on, Mrs. Mizushima,” Dr. Takahashi patted my back while I lay face down on the couch. A bit of friendship had settled between us. “You can’t throw in the towel yet.”“Why not?” I said, still breathing leather. “You know the saying, ‘Winners know when to quit.’”“You won’t earn anything by quitting your marriage.”“My sanity?”“You’re not insane, just crazy for your husband.”With a sigh, I pushed myself up and sat straight, face-to-face with my counselor. “Sometimes I feel like I don’t have a husband.”“You do,” Dr. Takahashi said. “Just think about the happy moments with him.”I gazed at the ceiling fan, letting it stir my thoughts. “Yasushi used to tell me about his day. Every day.”“Unusual from a husband…”I nodded. “And they were all about little things — how he picked his polka-dot tie instead of the striped one. What mobile games he played on his way to work. Why he felt like calling me on his lunch break.”“You didn’t feel bored?”I shook my head. “I love him, so nothing he says is boring.”Dr. Takahashi flashed me a warm smile. “You seem to love him a lot.”I gave her another nod. “I love him, hate him, admire him, despise him. He’s every feeling I’ve had for the past 10 years.”“And I’m sure he’ll make you feel much more.” Dr. Takahashi slumped herself down into her lounge chair. “I say this because you two are in a dream marriage. And dream marriages always have a happy ending.”For the first time that day, my lips curled upward instead of downward. True, this wasn’t a fictional story. But reality had its own magic.As a last resort, Dr. Takahashi suggested I try the atomic bomb of marriage reconciliation tactics. Going on a date. Which is a strange thing to do with someone you see every day. Someone you share your bed with. It’s like trying to catch a fish you already ate.However, I liked the idea. Yasushi and I hadn’t been on a date since he stopped talking to me. I texted him that same day.We haven’t spoken in a while, but I had fun with you last time we talked. How about we hang out again? We can do it at that Italian restaurant where we first met. I’ll be waiting there at 6 p.m at the same table. No pressure. But if you don’t show up, I’ll slice your little friend into spaghetti strands tonight.And I pressed send.The restaurant looked the same as 10 years ago, a life-sized picture. Old-style lanterns, rusty brick walls, arched glassless windows overlooking Tokyo DisneySea. It brought my mind to the past. To the first time I met Yasushi. The only memory I could play in my mind like a movie.That day, 10 years ago, I came to this expensive place to prove that I wasn’t ashamed of being single on Valentine’s Day. That I could have fun alone — actually, this yearly ritual made me feel even more lonely. Anyhow, you got to show the world you’re strong.However, I displayed my bravery to the wrong people, a couple two tables from mine enjoying a double espresso. They stole mocking glances at me, probably thinking, “Look at her. She’s a future crazy old cat lady.”I didn’t mind. Let them enjoy their last happy moments together — before they began fighting about things that they wouldn’t even remember. Before they were so fed up with each other they’d do extra time at work.Ignoring them had been useless.As I turned my eyes to my tuna spaghetti, a shadow hovered over my plate. I looked up to face the guy from the couple’s table. Crew cut, pudgy lips, thin-framed glasses.Great. Adult bullying as a Valentine’s Day gift.“It wasn’t enough to laugh from your table?” I said, casting my eyes down again.“I wasn’t laughing,” the guy said. “My date was.”“Well, go back to her. I’m busy here working on my spaghetti.”“I can’t. She’s not at our table anymore.”“What?” I peeked over his broad shoulder. He was right. The table hosted only two lonely espresso cups. “Oh, I get it. You had a fight with your date, she left, and now I’m going to be your backup plan. Very smart, Mr. Romeo, but I don’t like being the second choice.” I gobbled down a mouthful of spaghetti.“All right.” The guy spun around. “I’ll leave you alone then.”Before he could arrive at his table, I asked, “So, what happened? What was the fight about?”He looked back. “I didn’t like the way she was laughing at you.”I swallowed again. This time my words.That was how I met Yasushi: him losing a companion and me finding one. I was grateful. Thanks to him, I had my first two-person date on Valentine’s Day. My first time not feeling lonely.We spoke a lot. Well, it was mostly Yasushi doing the talking. I enjoyed listening to him, though.“You have this talent for making everything sound interesting,” I commented. “It’s like magic.”“The magic isn’t coming from me, but this space between us.” He traced an invisible line from my chest to his. “A line that I’d like to shorten.”He accomplished that in less than three weeks. However, 10 years later, that line became wider than ever.Or maybe not?With tear-blurred eyes, I spotted a shadow on my empty plate. At last.“Yasushi!” I yelled, raising my head to — Dr. Takahashi?“May I join you, Mrs. Mizushima?” She set herself across from me with a somber expression.Wiping the evidence of my sobbing with a handkerchief, I asked, “Why are you here?” I’d only told her about my dating plan. Not invited her.“Sorry for coming. I don’t usually meet clients outside of sessions. But I didn’t want you to spend the evening alone.”I blinked at her. “What? You knew Yasushi wouldn’t come?”Dr. Takahashi nodded. “I found it very strange that your husband wouldn’t come to our sessions. So I’ve been doing some research and found out he — ”“Yasushi is alive!” I shouted, cupping my ears with my hands. “He’s just not speaking to me.”“Mrs. Mizushima… I know how hurt you are and how much you want that pain to go away. But if you don’t accept reality, you’ll never fix your, um, marriage.”“You lied to me.” I brought the handkerchief to my eyes again. “You said it would have a happy ending.”“Because I didn’t know the beginning — or rather, the end.”I knew the end.It began with a phone call from the police. It continued with them explaining the details of the car crash and with me explaining how I had misplaced Yasushi’s glasses. It ended with me crying next to his sheet-covered body in the hospital.From then on, he couldn’t talk to me, nor could I listen to him anymore.And it’s the same now. But who knows, perhaps — if Heaven or even Hell exists — I’ll meet Yasushi again. So he can tell me about his day.Written by"
92,There’s an Epidemic That’s a Bigger Threat Than the Coronavirus,"Anyone can publish on Medium per our Policies, but we don’t fact-check every story. For more info about the coronavirus, see cdc.gov.You are, probably, worrying about coronavirus. For most of us, the anxious questions are: Am I going to get the coronavirus? Is someone I love going to get it? If we do, is it going to kill us?For starters, let’s be clear that no one ever gets a health guarantee. You might still have a heart attack even if you do everything advisable to avoid one. If you eat optimally, exercise, don’t smoke, and so on- you make heart disease or cancer vastly less probable, but you don’t get a guarantee. Human health simply does not come with those. And, of course, you can do everything right to be fit and healthy and keep your coronaries pristine, reliably avoid heart disease, and still get hit by a bus, or a falling tree, or lightning. Or get a brain tumor, for reasons we don’t know.One thing you learn in medicine is that we control ship and sail, but never wind and wave. We don’t control everything, ever. Bad things happen to good people doing everything right all the time. But they do happen much less often to those doing everything right than to everyone else, so what we do matters enormously. It shifts probability.So, the questions about coronavirus revert to questions about probability. And those we can answer, or at least establish the basis for answers.The ultimate questions — will I get this disease, and will it kill me if I do? — can be broken into component parts.Right now, unless you are in one of the rarefied populations around the world where the disease is concentrated, the answer is: probably very, very, very low. There are, as I write this (2/28/20) just under 84,000 global cases out of a population of nearly 8 billion humans. That is one case per 100,000. For comparison, the lifetime risk of being struck by lightning in the United States is roughly one in 3,000. The coronavirus numbers could change, of course, and likely will, but for now- total cases are of a “one in many, many thousands” magnitude, making exposure for any one of us highly improbable.Being exposed is necessary, but not sufficient, to get infected.This is the infection rate. If we use the most concentrated outbreak in Wuhan, China, as our model, with the assumption (obviously not entirely true) that everyone there was “exposed,” then the answer at the moment is just under 79,000 cases in a population of 11 million. That is an infection rate of roughly 7 per thousand, or 0.7 percent.UPDATE 3/09: Only South Korea is doing testing extensively enough to give us a realistic view of the fatality rate of COVID-19. It is much LOWER in South Korea than anywhere else, 0.6% — due to more extensive testing.This is the fatality rate. Once again, the most dire numbers come from Wuhan, where there have been just under 2,800 deaths among the just under 79,000 infected. That ratio yields a fatality rate of less than 4 per hundred, or just under 4 percent.I hasten to apologize for any semblance here that these numbers are adequate messengers. Every number in this mix is a real person just like you and me, with a family just like yours or mine. One of the great liabilities of public health is the capacity to lose the human reality of it in a sea of anonymizing statistics. As I use numbers to make my point, I point to the people behind the veil of those numbers, those families, and invite us both to direct the full measure of our condolence, our compassion, and the solidarity of our human kinship there. Among the messages of this, and any, pandemic is that however good we may be at accentuating our superficial differences, we are one, great, global human family- the same kind of animal, with just the same vulnerabilities. COVID-19 does not care at all who issued our passport.OK, back to numbers. Here’s an important reality check: We are much, much more likely to overlook the mildest cases of any disease than death from that disease. Death is hard to miss.What would it mean if this common scenario pertains to COVID-19? It means many more people than we know are getting the infection, but with mild symptoms passing for a cold, or maybe even no symptoms at all. The “bad news” here is that the infection rate might be much higher than we think. But does that increase your risk of getting the disease (yes!), and dying from it (no!)? I’ll illustrate.Let’s say you are a member of a hypothetical population of 2,000 people. We believe this population was exposed to coronavirus, that 200 people got infected, and that 8 died.The infection rate here is (200/2000) or 10 percent (much higher than the reality in Wuhan), and the fatality rate is (8/200), or 4 percent (about what has been seen to date in Wuhan). If you are a typical member of this population, your risk of both getting the infection and dying from it is {(200/2000) X (8/200)}, or 0.4 percent. We can see this directly from the total population numbers: 8 deaths out of 2000 is, just as our calculations showed, 4 deaths per thousand, or 0.4 percent. And to flip this around, it means your chances of dodging the coronavirus bullet are 99.6 percent. Those are good odds!But what if we were wrong — not a little, but a lot — about the number of infections, because we had overlooked many that were too mild to attract anyone’s attention? Well, then, maybe 4 times as many actually got infected- 800, rather than 200. This does mean you are much more likely to get the virus yourself, but does that make it more likely you will die from it? Not at all. The simple math shows why.We now have an infection rate of (800/2000), or a very alarming 40 percent. But we now also have a fatality rate of only (8/800), or 1 percent. If we repeat the prior calculation for your personal risk of getting the virus and dying from it, we have: {(800/2000) X (8/800)}, or…the exact same 0.4 percent as before.This is true of coronavirus in the real world. If we are finding every case, then your risk of getting infected is, for now at least, very low, and your risk of dying if you do is also very low. If we are missing a lot of cases, your risk of infection may be much higher, but your risk of dying if infected is commensurately lower. It’s a zero-sum game, and each sum, for now, means a very low probability indeed that you or someone you love will die from this disease.Before we wrap up, let’s examine our propensity for risk distortion whenever confronting the new, the seemingly exotic, and the uncertain — and let’s consider how epidemiologic familiarity clearly does breed contemptuous disregard.Worries over the exotic coronavirus are roiling the world now in every way imaginable. Those not anxious about life, limb, and loved ones are fretting over their stock portfolios.To date, there are a total of 60 cases in the United States — and zero deaths. In contrast, humble influenza thus far this year has infected as many as 40 million of us (about 1 in 9) and caused as many as 40,000 deaths (a fatality rate of 1 per thousand). We breathlessly await the rushed development of a vaccine for COVID-19, even as we balk ever more routinely at a flu vaccine which is in fact very safe, effective at reducing infection and transmission, and directed at a disease so far many orders of magnitude more dire than the coronavirus.Nor is our penchant for risk distortion limited to infectious diseases. As I write this, I am mere days away from the release of my new book, co-authored with Mark Bittman, “How to Eat.” We wrote the book together not because we weren’t already busy enough, but because infusing the conversation about diet and health in America with science filtered through a generally missing lens of sense is that important.Poor overall diet quality is the single leading cause of premature death in the United States today, causing an estimated 500,000 or so deaths each year. That is more than ten times worse than a fairly bad strain of influenza, monumentally worse than coronavirus thus far, and happens every year.Diet — what should be a source of nourishment, sustenance, and vitality — is the reason for one death in six here. And that is just the tip of the epidemiologic iceberg, since diet causes much more morbidity than premature death. To borrow directly from Dariush Mozaffarian and Dan Glickman in The New York Times:More than 100 million adults — almost half the entire adult population — have pre-diabetes or diabetes. Cardiovascular disease afflicts about 122 million people and causes roughly 840,000 deaths each year, or about 2,300 deaths each day. Three in four adults are overweight or obese. More Americans are sick, in other words, than are healthy.The exposure risk for diet is 100 percent; everyone eats. So for coronavirus to rival diet, every last one of us would need to be exposed.Poor overall diet quality is the single leading cause of premature death in the United States today, causing an estimated 500,000 or so deaths each year. That is more than ten times worse than a fairly bad strain of influenza, monumentally worse than coronavirus thus far, and happens every year.Let’s say that the ‘infection rate’ for diet is the probability of it harming you. Since less than 10 percent of Americans meet recommendations for fruits and vegetables, and since overall diet quality is poor on average, we can say that diet is harming — to one degree or another — at least 90 percent of us. So, for coronavirus to rival that, 90 out of 100 people exposed — almost everyone — would need to get infected.What about mortality? The deaths attributed directly to diet don’t really tell the whole tale. Diet is the major contributor to diabetes, heart disease and stroke, and an important contributor to cancer, liver disease, dementia and more. At least 50 percent of all premature death can be traced to effects of diet in whole or part, so let’s call the fatality rate 50 percent. For coronavirus to match that, the virus would need to kill one out of every two of us infected.Admittedly, coronavirus kills quickly when it kills, and diet tends to kill more slowly. This matters, but less than first meets the eye. Dying prematurely and abruptly is bad, but dying prematurely after a long chronic disease — losing life from years before losing years from life — is no bargain either. We have a native blind spot for any risk that plays out slowly rather than immediately — but climate change shows how calamitously costly that can prove to be. So, OK, coronavirus “wins” for speed, but really deserves far less preferential respect than it gets. Flu warrants far more. Diet, willfully engineered to put profit ahead of public health while evoking no apparent outrage, warrants far more still.Back to COVID-19, sure it is scary, mostly because of the attendant uncertainties. The relatively unknown threat is always the scariest. But for the coronavirus to rival mundane but massively greater risks that hide in plain sight and go routinely neglected, it would need to be literal orders of magnitude worse than it has thus far shown itself to be. That might happen — but we might also be struck by a large asteroid while worrying about it.I am not saying “don’t worry, be happy.” I am saying, if your worries relate to you or those you love getting sick and dying, that they could be far more productively directed than at COVID-19. I am saying get some perspective, get a grip, get a flu shot, drive a hybrid, go for a walk, and…eat a salad.— First published on Linkedin.Written by"
93,The Key to Lifelong Fitness is Inefficiency,"A few steps here, a heavy bag there. Carrying your own groceries and actually going to the bank. These inconveniences may save your life.My dog is perpetually dissatisfied. When he is inside, something out a window will catch his eye, and he scratches at the door to go out. Then realizing that it’s chilly, he wants to come back in after three minutes. Repeat.I was lamenting this fact while my parents were visiting and I had to jump out of my deep, cozy position on the couch to let him in and out and in and out.My mom disagreed.“I think it’s great,” she argued. “All that extra exercise you’ll get over the years of letting him in and out. You should hope he never changes!”This is the attitude my mom has about exercise. She has never joined a gym or played in an adult softball league. She’s never done a 5k or been to physical therapy. And yet she is one of the fittest 70 year old moms I know. When my friends meet her, they often comment that she is in ‘great shape.’When I was growing up, we heated our house with a wood stove. Our basement was layered with stacks of firewood that we would have to carry up each morning to stay warm through the long winters. As kids, we complained at the punishing difficulty of this task.My mom’s approach was different. Instead of loading up her arms with as many pieces as she could carry, she would take one log in each hand and pump her arms up and down over her head as she marched up the stairs. She’d repeat this until the woodbox was full. In her L.L. Bean slippers and mock turtleneck, she hardly looked like a gym rat, but the exercise was as punishing as some of the things my cross-fit friends do.I got an email at my job last week about parking. Due to some scheduling changes, I and about fifteen of my colleagues were being asked to park in a different place, about thirty paces away from where we used to park. The outrage about this situation was absurd and it made me question our constant desire to make our lives easier.We’ll drive around looking for the closest parking spot, wait in line for the drive-thru instead of parking and going inside, and boss around Alexa or Siri instead of getting up to check the weather or change the channel.Last week, at the recommendation of a friend, I tried Amazon’s grocery delivery service through Whole Foods. It was a Sunday morning, and I was low on food, but my kids were playing nicely and it was very cold. Log on, click on avocados, grapes, snow peas and peppers. Check out, pay a few bucks for delivery and next thing I knew, some dude in a grey sedan was carrying five bags of produce to my door.Trust me, it was pretty great. But it also made me feel pretty lazy. Instead of packing up the kids, making multiple trips to my car, pushing a cart around the store and then carrying my bags in, I sat on the sofa and shopped for new running shoes.We strive to reach the pinnacle of efficiency as if true happiness will come when we have to do absolutely nothing. We used to have to stand up and walk to the TV to change the channel. Then we at least had to pick our arm up and push a button to do it. Now with voice control, a task that used to take at least a small amount of coordination and strength, can be done without burning a fraction of a calorie.We have remote car starters, Door Dash delivery services, online banking, and an unbelievable number of apps that save us time and effort. While they are convenient, they come at the cost of not walking out to the car, walking in and out of the bank, and trying on a dozen pairs of shoes at the shoe store instead of just ordering four pairs online because there are free returns.There might be a select few of us who use all the time made available by these conveniences to exercise, but the wild popularity of streaming services like Netflix and Hulu suggest something different.Speaking of exercise, consider this. There are 168 hours in a week. If you make it to the gym five times a week for a 1 hour workout, you’re spending 3% of your week exercising. That leaves 97% of the week for swiping, scrolling, searching and sleeping.Since my mom’s comment about my dog, I’ve been thinking a lot about adding inefficiencies into my life in order to squeeze in little bits of added fitness. I’ve started choosing parking spots that are further away. I carry my laundry baskets down to the washing machine when they are half full, even though it means I’ll need to take more trips.All of these tasks are simple, but they are hard to remember. Without thinking, my car slides into the closest spot.It makes sense though, because throughout most of human evolution, life was hard and looking for shortcuts and efficiencies was a definite survival advantage. Our desire to do things in the quickest, easiest way possible is buried deep in our DNA.But we may have outsmarted ourselves because obesity, heart disease and hypertension have reached alarming levels and are still on the rise in the U.S. There’s never a panacea, but what if a first step in fighting these deadly conditions is just to walk a little more, stand up a few extra times and to carry your own groceries?Isn’t it worth a shot?Your dog will thank you.Written by"
94,Top Google AI Tools for Everyone,"“We want to use AI to augment the abilities of people, to enable us to accomplish more and to allow us to spend more time on our creative endeavors.”— Jeff Dean, Google Senior FellowCalling Google just a search giant would be an understatement with how quickly it grew from a mere search engine to a driving force behind innovations in several key IT sectors. Over the past couple of years, Google has planted its roots into almost everything digital, be it consumer electronics such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, its underlying software such as Android and Chrome OS or the smart software backed by Google’s AI.Google has been actively innovating in the smart software industry. Backed by its expertise in search and analytical data acquired over the years have helped Google create various tools like TensorFlow, ML Kit, Cloud AI and many more for enthusiasts and beginners alike, trying to understand the capabilities of AI.Google AI is focused on bringing the benefits of AI to everyone.The following sections will shed more light on how Google has targeted its suite of tools to specific groups of users, such as Developers, Researchers and Organizations and how they can benefit from the AI tools by Google.With more developers diving into the world of AI seeing its potential, Google is catering to their dynamic needs by providing several powerful tools such as:The revolution is here! Welcome to TensorFlow 2.0.TensorFlow is Google’s offering to the world as an end-to-end open-source deep-learning library utilizing machine learning to improve the services provided by various of its products. Using TensorFlow’s suite of tools and libraries, developers can build highly precise and well-defined Machine Learning models.Offering smooth model building and flexible deployment on a variety of devices, TensorFlow can make creating and deploying complex AI models a breeze. With strong community support, there are plenty of ideas to get you started, whether you’re a novice or an experienced individual.Let’s see some samples here.Get Ready for TensorFlow Dev Summit 2020 —ML Kit is a mobile-only SDK, currently available to Android & iOS to leverage the benefits of Google’s Machine Learning onto your mobile apps and prepare them to solve real-world problems. ML Kit can help you achieve success in tasks driven by the underlying Machine Learning techniques such as:● Language IdentificationPass text to ML Kit -> Get detected language in the textThis supports over 100 languages, including Hindi, Arabic, Chinese and many more!Find the entire list of supported languages here:● Text RecognitionClick a pic -> Get the text in the pic● Image Scanning and LabellingClick a pic -> Get a list of objects in the pic● Face RecognitionClick a pic -> Get all faces in the pic● Smart RepliesPass messages to ML Kit -> Get 3 smart replies● Barcode ScanningClick a pic -> Get info from the scanned barcode/QR code● Custom Model Integration with TensorFlow LiteWith ready-to-use APIs for on-device or cloud implementation for a variety of use-cases, you can easily apply your ML model to your data and track the performance of your app with an option for custom integration with TensorFlow Lite.As newer and better software gets developed every day, there is a constant need to take it to the next level. Once developers start creating code that is open-source only then the community can actively participate and help improve and expand upon it. With freely available code, developers can modify and scale the code by accessing its repository, often solving complex problems in the process.Google has pledged to bring the developers together by encouraging them to make their code openly available to anyone interested in the idea behind it. Google has offered loads of free and open-source projects such as:● ClusterFuzz, that has uncovered more than 11000 bugs within the last two years in several projects.● AutoFlip, which intelligently reframes videos to fit modern devices.● Blockly, that offers easy coding via drag-and-drop code blocks which can even be used to create business logic.Google, in its Open Source initiative, offers Fairness Indicators. It is a tool that providing metrics to quantify fairness in a machine learning system. Powered by TensorFlow, the intent is to eliminate any bias from a machine learning system while improving its fairness and decreasing unfair biases from impacting systems and organizations. With the ability to scale-up as the need grows, Google designed this with all kinds of businesses in mind.Colaboratory or Colab, in short, is an online code editor and compiler for Python. Think of it as Google Docs but for Python, backed by the storage capabilities provided by the likes of Google Drive. It is relatively easy to use and eliminates the hassle of sharing configurations across multiple users, simplifying the collaboration process. It also offers the ability to work remotely on your code with the option to create markdowns for detailed explanations with code snippets.To more info what Google Colab is please check out the video —While diving into a new field of study, extensive research is an absolute must. With comprehensive and rich datasets generated by the existing models which are openly available to the users, Google has simplified the process to get your hands on them by offering the following tools:With every machine learning model, the fundamental problem is to train it with correct data. Google Datasets caters to that problem by offering datasets.Google Datasets is a collection of datasets curated by Google that is periodically refreshed by analyzing the broad range of interests of the researchers.Google offers quite a broad range of dataset categories covering images, transcribed audios, videos, and text. Targeted towards a wide variety of users with varying use-cases, each category features a detailed run-down of the dataset with download links for easy access.Once users download the datasets and train their model on the datasets, they can prepare their models for real-world scenarios. Search for more datasets can be done via the Google Dataset Search.With each model on the internet generating its dataset, Google has helped ease the process of sharing the datasets with other users on the internet by providing a search feature. Much like its search service that searches anything on the web, Google’s Dataset Search narrows down your search for the dataset you’re looking for. From there on, you can know more about the dataset and get your hands on it.Data is King and Google Knows itAnother initiative by Google to increase the accuracy of its datasets by presenting users with fun challenges, asking them to recognize various categories of images such as drawings, letters, newspapers, illustrations and many more.From these categories, contributors can identify and label the pictures from provided choices to improve Google’s services. You will be awarded a fun badge and given milestones to achieve once you start contributing if you have that competitive spirit.Google Crowdsource not just works on images but a variety of other sections like:- Handwriting Recognition- Facial Expressions- Translations- Translation Validation- Image Captions- Image Label VerificationBy closely monitoring the market, Google can identify how its services can turn an enterprises’ potential milestone into an achieved target. Google offers businesses with tools that can streamline their workflow and reach new heights by adopting the expertise of AI and ML. From precise datasets, custom models, high-performance cloud services and much more, Google has a lot to offer to enterprises of all scales.Several organizations have benefitted from Google’s AI tools such as Lyft, Max Kelsen, eBay and Two Sigma, to name a few. Organizations can benefit off the following Google AI tools:With all the number crunching, Machine Learning requires a high-performance system. And just for that, Google built its TPU, short for Tensor Processing Unit that serves just that. By equipping businesses with the firepower they want, without any on-premises setup, Cloud TPU enables enterprises to offer their best services to customers by reducing hardware costs.Enterprises can settle on their preferred choice of cloud TPU, ranging from less demanding tasks to the most demanding ones and pick one from below offered options:● Cloud TPU v2● Cloud TPU v3● Cloud TPU v2 Pod● Cloud TPU v3 PodCloud AI enables you to implement machine learning capabilities into your business so that it is always ready to take on new challenges. Using Cloud AI, businesses can use the already available models provided by Google or go ahead and customize one to their liking.Cloud AI is broken down into three components. Cloud AI consists of —- AI HubProvides a collection of ready to use AI components with options to share and experiment on the models.- AI Building BlocksAllows the developers to add conversation, sight, language, structured data and Cloud AutoML capabilities to their application.- AI PlatformAI Platform empowers data scientists, engineers and developers to quickly turn their ideas to deployment with several services such as AI Platform Notebooks, Deep Learning Containers, Data Labelling Services, Continuous Evaluation, AI Platform Training and more.Interesting Reading —Being used by popular brands such as Disney, Imagia, Meredith and more, Cloud AutoML enables effortless training of custom machine learning models to generate high-quality training data.

95,How top CS students problem solve,"The top students of today earn the craze of recruiting from top companies — they show consistent ways to out-innovate problems and create value.When lecturing, I notice how the best students are always asking the question as to where we are going in a lecture before I introduce it. Underpinning the next two sections is a clear ability to build conceptual maps. I know I am a fairly idea-centric lecturer, and these students don’t miss a beat. The raw compute power is impressive.I’ll tell this story with a running multi-agent learning contest, where we wanted to optimally solve new Pac-man puzzles. This is designed to be a small amount of extra credit for above and beyond students, but it ended up giving great insight into what the top minds are doing. The scoring was as follows:I’ve heard so many stories about how hard undergrads at UC Berkeley work, but it’s hard to know what that means or how it translates into practical productivity without examples.A student who got second place in the Pac-man contest ultimately ran a brute force bash script overnight to create a feedback loop over the random seeds and upload new solutions to the test case we were trying (poorly) to keep hidden. The reason the student wasn’t disqualified: he documented his approach and we had not created a rule against this. A new feature of the contests is averaging over multiple seeds (obvious to scientists, yes) so that the signal returned from the contest is not as direct.Below is a summary of the ‘wow’ contest submission, it seemed like the student may have used some shady practices to hard-code solutions (hard coding will remove the computation time penalty on score), but they set up a minor class competition as a serious engineering problem. Here’s how in some of his own words:There are some serious insights in this process, combined with the force of will and motivation to get it done. So what it takes to be a top student at a top CS university is the ability and the will the walk oneself through this kind of rigorous implementation. I would not say I have that level of fine tuning — maybe that’s why I am a graduate student and not a software engineer.The brute force solution is all about building a better toolkit, but ultimately the student lost to a clever solution that is from one stroke of genius.The top scorer in a class of 900 students was the one that made a change to the problem setting that made their score so much higher (10% margin). In a game penalizing extra actions, this student made 3 of the agents take no actions, and solved the game with one search agent.Score — 1327.This is the other half of the equation to brute force engineering. It’s the stroke of insight that seems simple post-hoc, but so few have.The best students find the ways to win, and often result in the rules of the future. As course staff, the detail is impressive. This is the kind of effort that gets products out the door, and I strongly stand by these students’ scores. It’s not a requirement to be successful to have these types of effort and insights, but they can take you very far.I choose to define my own success on how I perform, so I don’t worry about trying to replicate any crazy win like this. You can have a great career through consistency and enjoyment, but it’s fun to see how some of the best minds break problems down.I completed my undergrad almost 3 years ago at Cornell University, and it was almost 6 years before I was really trying to make a name for myself in my first competitive engineering classes. I’m not sure if it’s just a change of perspective, but I have been impressed by the students. I’m sure they’ll be rewarded for their hard work.More thoughts on lecturing can be found here.Written by"
96,The Magic and the Myths Behind Infrared Light,"For more information on the novel coronavirus and Covid-19, visit cdc.gov.This story is a part of Elemental Light Week, a 5-day series on what light does for your body, brain, and well-being.Humans are inundated with light waves every second of every day. There’s the light we think about — visible light pouring forth from the sun and electric light bulbs and ultraviolet (UV) light that turns our skin red, tan, and eventually wrinkled. And there’s the light we don’t think about, like the radio waves bouncing off of us and the gamma rays that shoot right through us. Given the ubiquity, diversity, and power of light, everyone from neurologists to dermatologists to wellness gurus are trying to harness light waves to enhance and heal the body. And although it sounds pretty fringe, it turns out there’s more to light than meets the eye.In part because of the clear impact UV light has on the skin, dermatology has led the charge in using light therapeutically — harnessing red, blue, and even UV light itself to get rid of acne, eczema, and pre-cancerous skin cells. More recently, anesthesiologists started to explore whether green light can be used to dull the pain from migraines and fibromyalgia. More than any other wavelength, though, infrared light appears to have the most therapeutic potential, and advocates claim it can treat everything from arthritis to Alzheimer’s disease.While it may seem far-fetched that light has all these effects on the body, it begins to make more sense when you think of light as a form of energy. That energy can affect the behavior of the electrons in atoms that are in, well, everything. What we experience as visible light is really just one small portion of what’s called the electromagnetic spectrum, which consists of different wavelengths of energy-carrying photons. This spectrum ranges from radio waves, which are very long, low-energy wavelengths, to gamma rays, the shortest and highest-energy wavelengths. It includes microwaves and X-rays, too.The visible light rainbow (remember ROYGBIV?) sits in the middle of the spectrum. These wavelengths of energy are the only ones that our eyes can naturally perceive, but that doesn’t mean the other wavelengths don’t exist. Red is the longest visible light wavelength, and infrared is the name of wavelengths longer than red. Infrared light is outside of our field of vision, but you can see it with night-vision goggles.More than any other wavelength, though, infrared light appears to have the most therapeutic potential.Scientists have discovered that infrared light can penetrate cells and tissues in the body by an inch and a half and heat them up. This has spurred the rise of infrared saunas, which have gained popularity in recent years through endorsements by the celebrity Pseudoscience Squad — Gwyneth Paltrow, Jack Dorsey, Joe Rogan, Tom Brady, and the Kardashian sisters. Manufacturers and proponents of infrared saunas make the classic Wellness™ claim that they “detoxify” the body — and by “detox,” they mean by enabling you to sweat in a special way that purges your cells of heavy metals, calories, and signs of aging. In case it needs saying, sweat is the same no matter how it’s produced, and it does not detoxify the body (the liver and kidneys do). The purpose of sweat is to cool you down when it evaporates off your skin.While traditional saunas heat up the ambient temperature of the room, infrared saunas heat the cells in your body. Infrared lamps used in incubators for premature babies and in cafeteria heat lamps to keep French fries warm employ the same technology. Because they heat you up from the inside out instead of outside in, infrared saunas run cooler than regular saunas, maxing out at 120 degrees Fahrenheit instead of 200 degrees. This means you might be able to last longer in an infrared sauna than you could in a traditional one. Other than that, there’s really no difference between the two, and the general consensus seems to be that any health effects conferred by infrared saunas likely stem from the heat rather than the light itself.This is not to say that saunas — infrared or otherwise — don’t have their benefits. There is some evidence, particularly from Scandinavian and East Asian studies, that they may improve circulation and cardiovascular function, reduce pain, and speed up muscle recovery. Regular sauna use is also linked to a longer lifespan, although whether that’s due to the sauna itself or a result of prioritizing relaxation and well-being is impossible to say.“The mid-infrared light in the sauna is really used more for health, wellness, athletic recovery, possibly increased athletic performance,” says Michael Hamblin, a principal investigator at the Wellman Center for Photomedicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. “There’s some evidence that it helps with all sorts of systemic disorders.”Notice Hamblin said mid-infrared light, which has longer wavelengths and is the kind of light used in infrared saunas. This is in contrast to near-infrared light, which has shorter wavelengths and is used in infrared helmets — literally a helmet or headset with small infrared lights glued to the inside.While traditional saunas heat up the ambient temperature of the room, infrared saunas heat the cells in your body.Hamblin has been researching the therapeutic effects of light, particularly near-infrared light, for decades, and he thinks it can treat everything from muscle pain to Alzheimer’s disease. He says the benefits of near-infrared light aren’t from the heat it provides but how it alters the body’s cells.“It’s astonishing the number of diseases and conditions you can treat,” he says. “You can use near-infrared for orthopedic things — injuries, arthritis, tendonitis, muscle pain. You can also use it on the head for the brain — for dementia, psychiatric disorders, head injuries. All sorts of disorders of the brain, it’s quite effective.”Dr. Julio Rojas-Martinez, an assistant professor of neurology at the University of California, San Francisco, who is also studying the effects of infrared light in the brain, admits that the idea is “alternative or underground.” “It’s not mainstream medicine,” he says. But despite its fringe status, he says there is good biological evidence to back up the claims that infrared light can affect brain cells.Here’s how it might work: Inside every cell in the body are mitochondria that provide energy for the cell. The vast majority of a person’s energy comes from glucose in the food they eat or that’s stored in the body, which the mitochondria turn into chemical energy that can be used by the cell. It turns out that there are also light receptors inside mitochondria that are sensitive to specific wavelengths of light — like near-infrared — and can turn light energy into cellular energy, similar to plants. This process is nowhere near as efficient as converting food into energy, so our cells don’t rely on light to function, but it suggests that certain wavelengths of light can give people a little boost.Researchers have demonstrated that shining infrared light on both human brain cells and live rat brains increases cellular metabolism, meaning the production and consumption of energy. Other studies have shown that infrared light can increase blood flow in the brain. In Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders, cellular metabolism is much lower than normal. Cognitive processes like encoding or retrieving a memory take cellular energy, and one theory about Alzheimer’s is that brain cells don’t have enough energy to perform these memory functions anymore. Rojas-Martinez thinks energy from light could help make up the difference, and he’s now testing whether infrared light can increase brain function in people with the disease.“You ask a patient with Alzheimer’s disease to learn something or to remember something, there’s going to be [an energy] demand on the memory networks,” says Rojas-Martinez. “But maybe that demand will be higher than what the brain can provide as an output. So the idea of the light therapy is to give the cells support so they can maintain the metabolic function.”Hamblin says his lab has shown in animal models that infrared light “can increase the number of brain cells and also the number of connections they have,” he says. “That was in animals, but we kind of assume the same thing happens in humans. It’s difficult to show, but we sort of assume that.”This assumption — that an effect in animals will also occur in humans — can be a much bigger problem than Hamblin suggests. So far, almost all of the research on the effect of infrared light on the brain has been done in mice or in tissue cells in a petri dish, which is very different from being done in a human. For instance, scientists have cured Alzheimer’s dozens of times in mice, yet virtually all drugs to treat dementia have failed in large human clinical trials.Hamblin isn’t put off by this lack of clinical evidence, though. He says it’s just a matter of getting enough money to run the trials, and then infrared light therapy will become more mainstream. “It’s going to happen gradually because the mainstream medical opinion leaders want to see randomized controlled clinical trials for each indication, and that’s going to take some time,” he says.Rojas-Martinez, on the other hand, isn’t convinced it will work despite his own research into the topic. “The evidence is there and there are enthusiasts around the world who are paying attention to it, but I remain skeptical,” he says. “I am interested in this field, but I think there are lots of questions.”There may be a biological rationale, but clinical studies to prove that near-infrared light therapy works in humans are still needed. So for now, hold off on buying an infrared helmet.

97,88 Ways to Not Freak the F*ck Out During Isolation,"For more information on the novel coronavirus and Covid-19, visit cdc.gov.There are about a gazillion articles on the internet right now listing facts, statistics, and recommendations regarding the threat we are facing with COVID-19. I’m glad those exist, but what I couldn’t find was one that simply told me how to not freak the fuck out.So I wrote one. Who am I? Not the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the World Health Organization (though I urge everyone to follow their websites for the latest updates). I am a 33-year-old woman currently living alone in San Antonio, Texas — 1,000 miles away from my partner, pets, and lifelong network of family and friends in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I’m asthmatic, have a suppressed immune system, and chronic migraines. Things have been rough.I wanted to channel my nervous energy into something that can help others, so I compiled a big list of ways to prepare, stay calm, and do the best you can do during these weeks of self-distancing. I looked to online resources, surveyed friends on Twitter, and drew from my own experience working at home as a freelancer. I hope some of these tips help you in the weeks and months ahead. Note: Please abide by your local restrictions, first and foremost.I know you know these, but it feels irresponsible not to include them.1. Wash your hands frequently. Use soap and water and scrub to the meme of your choice for at least 20 seconds. Washing hands is especially important before eating and whenever you go from space to space outside of your home, particularly after you interact with surfaces others have touched.2. Keep a six-foot distance from other people. Help #FlattenTheCurve.3. Don’t attend parties or gatherings.4. Stay home if you’re sick. Even if it’s that I-might-be-getting-a-sore-throat kind of sick.5. Only wear a mask if you are sick.6. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.7. Don’t be a fucking racist.8. Don’t assume that just because you’re “young and healthy” you can ignore all this. Even if you’re likely to recover from the disease if you get it doesn’t mean you can’t spread this shit to people who are more vulnerable.9. Decide where you want to be. Do you live alone? If so, do you want to be alone? Decide if you need to possibly stay with family, friends, or a partner, but really assess what situation will be most beneficial for everyone.10. Mentally prepare for what we are facing. Some people will try and calm your anxiety by minimizing the scale of this pandemic. For me, that ends up backfiring. While it’s not helpful to panic, do keep yourself informed and ready to do what you need to stay healthy and sane.11. Find trustworthy, reliable information. There are a lot of people panicking and sharing misinformation about COVID-19 online. Stick to up-to-date information from reputable sources, including the CDC or WHO, along with verified medical and public health professionals. If you feel yourself getting overly worked up when reading about COVID-19, step away and take a breath.12. Inventory your fears. Set a timer for two to five minutes and do a freewriting session on a piece of paper about whatever you’re thinking, including your worst fears. Getting these stressors out can feel good and will help you see what is or isn’t in your control.13. Inventory your needs. Set a timer for two to five minutes and do a separate freewriting session, this time about everything that makes you feel comfortable, safe, and loved. Set up your space accordingly and schedule time to meet whatever needs you’re able to address.14. Make a wellness checklist. Take out a pen and paper and write down five basic check-in questions to help yourself assess how you are doing and what you might need right now. These could be: When was the last time you had water? When was the last time you ate? When was the last time you stepped out into the sunlight? When was the last time you talked to someone? When was the last time you took a deep breath? Post these questions someplace where you will see them periodically throughout the day.15. Have a plan for what social distancing will look like for you. As of Tuesday, March 17, residents in six Bay Area counties will be under a “shelter in place” order, meaning that everyone will be required to stay inside their homes and away from others as much as possible for three weeks. For the rest of us, the rules of social distancing are a lot grayer. Consider your limits, and err on the side of caution.16. Have conversations with your older relatives about what they are feeling and what boundaries need to be established to keep them safe.17. If you feel like your friends and family aren’t taking precautions, invite them to have a real conversation with you about what’s going on. Tell them that you care about them and are worried about their health and safety. Offer them resources.18. Don’t just run to the store and start throwing things in your cart. Make a healthy quarantine shopping list, but be flexible, knowing that markets might be wiped out of many of the items you want.19. Create a cooking calendar or Google Doc filled with easy recipes that use very few ingredients. I’ve put together some ideas on this Pinterest board titled “Cooking in Isolation.” You don’t want to exhaust yourself trying to decide what to eat when you’re stressed.20. Clean and inventory the contents of your fridge, freezer, and pantry. You probably have more (nonexpired) food than you think.21. Stock up on nonperishable foods: canned items; dry goods like rice, beans, and lentils; and frozen fruit and vegetables.22. If you can’t afford food, don’t be afraid to visit a food pantry in your community. And if you can afford to donate to one, do.23. Buy good spices — in bulk if you can. Spices can make dry goods magically delicious without a ton of effort.24. Buy some treats, too. Are there certain foods that bring you comfort? Keep a supply of these goodies in your stash. We still need joy in our lives.25. Buy soap, lotion, and medication to treat the basic symptoms you might face if you get sick.26. Make sure you have refills of any necessary prescriptions. Our health care system will likely become overloaded. Don’t wait until then to stock up on what you need.27. If you can find one, buy a thermometer and, if you have multiple people at home, extra probe covers to go with it. Fever is the most common and consistent symptom of coronavirus and one of the first to present.28. Most importantly, don’t hoard when you shop. Remember that we are in a community, and when any of us take all of the resources, we are hurting all the people around us.29. Create a schedule. Wake up at the same time every day. If you are working from home, set work hours with a hard stop.30. Get the proper amount of sleep. Don’t short yourself but also don’t spend all day in bed.31. Get dressed every day. Even if you’re just changing into loungewear (aka daytime PJs), the ritual will boost your energy levels and help you to feel motivated.32. Practice good hygiene. Take a shower, brush your teeth, and floss. Don’t let the fact that you aren’t seeing people stop you from taking care of yourself.33. Keep your space tidy. When we’re anxious or depressed, our space can be the first thing to really suffer, which only makes us feel worse.34. Create a deep cleaning/disinfecting schedule, taking care to follow CDC guidelines. This is even more important in these times.35. Get right out of bed in the morning. Try not to look at social media, emails, and texts before your feet touch the floor.36. Keep taking your prescribed medications.37. Download a meditation app such as Calm or Headspace and start doing some basic meditation.38. Monitor how much you are drinking or using substances, and do a regular gut check to determine whether your habits are helping or harming you.39. If you are feeling like you are going to hurt yourself, call the Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800–273–8255.40. Ask for help. Whether it’s from a partner, parent, friend, or mental health professional, remember that there are people out there who will support you, but you can’t expect them to know what you need.41. Find some grounding techniques to quiet any distressing thoughts and refocus on the present. These techniques might include reciting a poem, completing some math problems, or imagining the voice of someone you love.42. If you need mental health care, in person, right now, look for a mental health urgent care clinic in your community. These are usually located in major hospitals.43. Set boundaries around social media. Whether you decide you’ll only check Facebook and Twitter during certain hours of the day or something totally different, have a plan and do your best to stick with it.44. Don’t be afraid of social media. As we become more isolated, we still need to keep up with people. But try to find the places online that make you feel good rather than stressed out.45. If you use Twitter and are feeling anxious, liberally use the mute feature to limit your exposure to certain keywords or users. You can find this in your settings under “Content preferences.”46. Set up a dedicated workspace, even if it’s just a card table or a section of the counter.47. Beyond having a set space, do other things to signal to yourself that it’s time to work. Play classical music, brew a pot of coffee, change the lighting, or what have you.48. Make a to-do list every day. A bullet journal can be helpful. I stick Post-it notes on the wall next to my desk. Do what works for you.49. Use the Pomodoro technique to keep yourself efficient and on-task.50. Talk with your partner/kids about boundaries during work times.51. If your pets are distracting, try and shut yourself away from them.52. Use headphones.53. Set weekly goals instead of daily goals. This is an uncertain time, and there may be some days when you can’t focus at all. Give yourself grace.54. Try to eat on a regular schedule. If you no longer have a set lunch hour, you might tend to graze all day or forget to eat. Make and maintain a meal schedule that works for you.55. Drink water. It’s easy to ignore your basic needs when you’re stressed. I set up my Apple watch to remind me to have a glass at regular intervals throughout the day.56. As much as you can, eat food that makes you feel good. Don’t be obsessive over your food choices, especially if you are prone to disordered eating, but notice what affects you positively and repeat those choices.57. If you decide to order food delivery, take proper precautions and tip more than usual. Our friends in the service industry are losing a lot of their income right now. You can also donate to the COVID-19 Crisis Relief Fund for restaurant workers, launched by the Restaurant Workers’ Community Foundation.58. You know those goals you’ve always wanted to accomplish? Pick one or two to focus on, break them up into smaller pieces, and dedicate some time to accomplishing them.59. Work on learning a new language or brushing up on the one you haven’t spoken since college. Duolingo is a good place to start.60. Read books. You’ve probably got more than a few laying around your house that you’ve bought and never read. You can also borrow ebooks or audiobooks from the library using the Libby app. To make things more interesting, follow the 2020 Tournament of Books.61. Try an online course. There’s so much to learn on sites like Skillshare and MasterClass. There are also 450 Ivy League courses that you can take online, right now, for free.62. Learn to cook and bake things you’ve never made before. Baking bread is incredibly relaxing once you do it a few times. Here’s a good recipe.63. It’s easy to let your days slip away to Netflix. Give yourself a TV limit. You don’t want to fall into a black hole.64. Maybe don’t watch Contagion.65. But do watch TV shows and movies that give you joy.66. Color. Paint. Doodle.67. Order some simple craft supplies, like yarn and knitting needles. It feels good to make things with your hands. Personally, I’m really obsessed with these tiny dollhouse kits.68. Do a puzzle. It can help you get out of your head.69. Try a calming mobile game like My Oasis or Neko Atsume.70. Buy a Lego kit to assemble. Just don’t leave any pieces on the floor.71. Talk to your friends on the phone or using video chat, especially if you are alone.72. Call your parents regularly if you are in each other’s lives. They are probably worried.73. If it’s been really quiet and you just want to hear another human voice, turn on a conversation-style podcast. I really love The Read.74. Talk with your friends about how you can spend time together virtually — can you all eat breakfast together on video chat one morning?75. Ride your bike solo. It’s safe to enjoy the outdoors as long as you’re practicing social distancing.76. Teach yourself to dance. Check out one of the many tutorials on YouTube — or just put on some music and move.77. Follow a basic yoga routine, or follow along with a YouTube video, like the ones from Yoga with Adriene.78. Have a real conversation with everyone in your house about your boundaries, needs, and expectations.79. Play some games together. Board and card games are a great way to get some time away from screens.80. Make sure to get time apart however you can.81. If you’re with your partner, maintain some normalcy by making out and having sex — as long as you’re healthy and have both been practicing self-distancing.82. Alone or just don’t feel like taking the risk? Discover the joys of phone sex.83. Masturbate. I probably don’t have to tell you to do this, but it can be easy to forget our sexual needs when we are overwhelmed.84. Order a vibrator online if you don’t have one. Here’s my recommendation.85. Make a plan for how you can help your friends, neighbors, and people who are the most impacted.86. If you have extra money, consider sending it to friends who don’t, who are losing their jobs or losing tips. Or make a donation to a local solidarity fund or food bank.87. Try to be frugal and stick to a budget so you can afford to help others and be prepared financially for the worst of what might come.88. Foster an animal if your situation allows. If you’re going to be home, it can provide companionship.That’s all I’ve got for now. I hope you are able to do what you need to do to get through this time. Just don’t forget to wash your hands.Written by"
98,Coronavirus: Why it’s so deadly in Italy,"Anyone can publish on Medium per our Policies, but we don’t fact-check every story. For more info about the coronavirus, see cdc.gov.As we study the numbers on the coronavirus cases and the deaths related to COVID-19, a similar question comes up again and again:Why is the coronavirus causing so many more deaths in Italy than in other countries?This question relates both to the absolute number of deaths , which is currently exceeded only in China, and to the case fatality rate, which has risen to 6.6% and exceeds any other country in the world.To make sure we are all on the same page: The case fatality rate of COVID-19 is the number of confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 divided by the total number of confirmed cases of infections with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The case fatality rate (CFR) should not be confused with the mortality rate or death rate (while it often is confused with them), which is simply the total number of deaths that occur during a specific time frame divided by the number of the total population at approximately the same time. Currently, we are more interested in the CFR because we see the number of cases growing and we want to know how many of these diagnosed cases will result in the death of the patients. The CFR is currently at 0.066 or 6.6% in Italy, 2.1% in France, 0.8% in South Korea, and 0.2% in Germany, according to the latest data collected by worldometer. What explains these immense differences?Let us assume every country is equally capable of counting the numerator of the CFR, the fatalities due to COVID-19, and will report them accurately; an assumption that is tolerable if we focus on non-authoritarian high-income countries. What do we then need to know about the denominator, the confirmed cases? The strongest predictors of fatality due to COVID-19 are age and pre-existing conditions of the infected. The number of pre-existing conditions is positively correlated with age, so let us for simplicity only look at the age of the confirmed cases. Clearly, because age is so predictive of death by COVID-19, comparing the case fatality rates across countries only makes sense if the underlying cases of coronavirus have approximately the same age across countries.What do we know about the age of the people that have been found to be infected with the coronavirus? This information is not easy to find, but it has been popping up in reports and newspapers from the various countries over the past days. The diagrams and figures reported in the following are based on statistics reported by the Korean news agency news1 (screenshot) and the Italian daily newspaper Corriere della Sera.Grouping the age in ten-year-intervals and comparing the percentage shares of cases that fall into each age group reveals a striking dissimilarity between South Korea (red bars) and Italy (green bars): Recently, 3% of all confirmed cases in South Korea were at least 80 years old. At about the same time, 19.1% of all confirmed cases in Italy were at least 80 years old.This enormous difference occurred while the absolute numbers of confirmed cases overall were similar in the two countries (8,036 in Italy vs 7,134 in South Korea). Consequently, Italy’s healthcare and hospital system had to take care of a much higher number of infected older patients than the South Korean one — patients that need more intensive care and that are simultaneously more likely to pass away.A clear implication is that the Italian CFR is not comparable to the Korean CFR — the people infected with the coronavirus that enter the Italian CFR are much older than those that enter the Korean CFR, and as older people are much more likely to die of COVID-19, they push the Italian CFR upwards. Another implication is that explaining the different CFRs with differences in the healthcare and hospital systems between Italy and South Korea might be premature — in the current coronavirus crisis, South Korea’s hospitals and intensive care units have never been tested to the extent that Italy’s currently are.An obvious question that follows is: Why do these age distributions look so different in the two countries? Many people have already pointed out that Italy has an older population than South Korea. The higher Italian CFR might therefore reflect a higher likelihood that an old person becomes infected with the coronavirus simply because there are more old people among the Italian population. We can easily check the plausibility of this argument by comparing the age structure of the coronavirus cases with the age structure of the total population for both countries. The population data are from the United Nations’ World Population Prospect 2019.In South Korea, the age structure of the coronavirus cases is remarkably similar to the age structure of the population, in particular for the older age groups. The 20–29-year-olds are still hugely overrepresented among the confirmed cases relative to their population share, but their surplus is balanced by the underrepresentation of cases among the 0–9- and 10–19-year-olds. These three youngest age groups face a very low risk of dying from COVID-19. The South Korean CFR is hence not depressed or exaggerated by an under- or overrepresentation of older Koreans among the confirmed cases.The same is not true for Italy: The share of confirmed cases at age 70–79 exceeds the population share of this age group by more than a factor of two. Among those aged 80 and more, the case share is almost three times as high as the population share. By contrast, young people and hence low-fatality-risk people are visibly underrepresented among the confirmed cases.Hence, the question remains why the age distribution of cases is shaped so differently in Italy compared to South Korea. It has also been pointed out that the testing procedures for coronavirus in the countries are very different — Italy has predominantly been testing people with symptoms of a coronavirus infection, while South Korea has been testing basically everyone since the outbreak had become apparent. Consequently, South Korea has detected more asymptomatic, but positive cases of coronavirus than Italy, in particular among young people.A complementary reason is that the Korean outbreak took place mainly among followers of the Shincheonji megachurch/sect in and around the city of Daegu. Possibly, many followers of this movement are of relatively young age, explaining the unusual spike of cases among the 20–29-year-olds once testing intensified around this group. This might have also prevented the virus from spreading extensively among the Korean elderly so far. With regard to Italy, we do not know who spread the virus among the old population of the North — but the surprisingly high number of tourists that have been diagnosed with coronavirus after returning from trips to Northern Italy suggests that the unnoticed and asymptomatic spread of the virus has probably been going on there for quite some time, building up to then ravage the elderly.The bottom line is that the coronavirus hit Italy and South Korea very differently in terms of age at around the same time and the same level of the outbreak — at least the level that we noticed in terms of confirmed cases — thereby causing a much higher number of deaths in Italy. An implication is that simply tracing the number of confirmed coronavirus cases by country over time, as many graphs and website currently do, is not telling the full story. The raw number of cases is a rather poor predictor of deaths by COVID-19, at least in the short-run. If the virus spreads predominantly among young people, as appears to have been the case in South Korea, there is no immediate risk of collapse to the hospitals. However, if it spreads to the old population, as in Italy, collapse is looming; and it might be a matter of days. When (not if) this happens is another factor that is hard to predict, as some efforts are underway.From these two rather polar-opposite cases of Italy and South Korea, what can be learned for other countries? Age aggregates for a subsample of the German confirmed cases of coronavirus have been published by the Robert Koch Institute, which is a German federal government agency responsible for disease control and prevention. Let us assume the subsample is representative. The age aggregates are not the same as in the Italian and Korean data, but cases can still be allocated to two groups: those younger than 60 years and those 60 years or older.Based on this comparison, Germany has even been a bit “luckier” than South Korea for now, as the coronavirus apparently has been spreading among the younger German population. This finding could be reflected in the currently very low German CFR of 0.2%. The concentration of cases of coronavirus among its younger population might have provided Germany with a bit more time to prepare itself for the moment when the number of infected will rise among its elderly. We have to keep in mind that 29% of Germany’s population is at least 60 years old, according to the Federal Statistical Office.The French National Health Agency has also published age aggregates of the confirmed cases, but the aggregates are not compatible with those of the other countries. Looking at the French data alone suggests that France represents a scenario somewhere between the Korean and the Italian one, as close to 30% of the French confirmed cases are at least 65 years old.Again, this pattern could be reflected in the current French CFR of 2.1%, which is ten times higher than the German one, but only 2.5 times higher than the Korean one. In absolute terms, France has already had almost as many deaths as South Korea due to COVID-19, and we should not expect the French death toll to stabilize soon. These are still very few data points and unfortunately, the availability of information on the age of confirmed cases will likely decrease as the case numbers grow and the situation might escalate in more countries.We can learn something more that is potentially very useful from the Korean statistics. We have seen above that the age distribution of the confirmed cases corresponds rather closely to the age distribution of the overall population in South Korea if we subsume everyone below age 30 into one group where almost nobody dies from COVID-19. At the time of reporting, 50 of the confirmed 7,134 people infected with the coronavirus had died, implying an aggregate CFR of 0.7%. Since then, the Korean CFR has been creeping up to 0.89%. Hence, 1% seems to be a reasonable estimate of the case fatality rate in a high-income country (!) in the absence of any major failures of the hospital and care system (!). This 1% CFR estimate is close to what Dr. Jeremy Faust has been suggesting based on the Diamond Princess cruise ship case.Clearly, one of the worst conclusions that could be drawn from this is that the various case fatality rates across countries will settle down at 1% eventually all by themselves. They won’t. Due to the hospital system becoming overwhelmed in Northern Italy, we already have excess mortality there that cannot be undone. Germany, with its low share of individuals infected with the coronavirus at higher age, might have gained some valuable time, but this is just a time lag, it is not a restraint to the coronavirus spreading further to the elderly soon. The relatively high and quickly growing case fatality rates in France and especially in Spain suggest that the virus has already infected a large number of older and vulnerable citizens in these countries. Regarding the US, we are still completely in the dark. Everything that is being said about the need for social distancing and in particular the protection of the elderly remains ever so true.Update 1 (minor): I corrected a typo: It’s “numerator” and not “nominator”, of course.

Thank you!Update 3 (one week later): Thanks to everyone who has read, shared, and responded to this story over the past week. A few observations: South Korea’s CFR now stands at 1.09%, Italy is still tormented by excess mortality, probably due to overwhelmed hospitals, and Germany’s CFR remains below 0.5%, while France’s has risen to worrisome 3.57%. At the same time, testing capacities and actual testing have increased in all countries. Obviously, I’m biased, but I interpret these development in the way that the demographic explanations for the varying case fatality rates I outline here do not apply only to short-lived data fragments, but that they fit and predict also sustained trends in case fatality rates.Written by"
99,How to Mass-Manufacture Humanoid Robots,"“I just do eyes!” may not be the most iconic words spoken in Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner, but they gesture toward a whole series of worldbuilding questions that have long fascinated fans (read: me, maybe only me). For a movie about victims of interplanetary exploitation seeking justice and standing up to corporate and state oppression, the supply chains of Blade Runner are surprisingly underexplored. If genetic designer Hannibal Chew does, in fact, “just do eyes” in his work for the Tyrell Corporation, who does the other parts? Is there a person who only does bones or skin? (According to a 1997 Blade Runner video game, there is.) And who exactly are Chew’s suppliers of vitreous humor? (Assuming that’s the material Chew’s putting into replicant eyes and not some alternative polymer.) Is he a subcontractor or a full employee? How much of Earth’s economy serves the manufacture of the off-world’s army of replicants?Now, in the third season premiere of Westworld, the mystery that surely gripped audiences for the two years between seasons, in which the hosts fled their carefully curated environment for the real world, will again be broached: How the hell will the hosts manage maintenance on their fragile bioengineered bodies in a brand-new biome without the benefits of a full repair shop? How will their immune systems handle the new environments? What if Dolores gets an STD? What if Bernard needs cortical fluid again? Come to think of it, what’s in cortical fluid?Of course, Westworld follows in a long sci-fi tradition of humanoid robots exhibiting total indifference to maintenance and supply chains except as short-lived McGuffins. In science fiction, a lot of attention goes to the software side of creating sentient A.I. — it’s a topic that lets otherwise-vacuous narratives pretend they’re really asking Smart Questions about “what it means to be human.” Meanwhile, the hardware (and, in some cases, wetware) side of these creations gets hand-waved away into a solved manufacturing problem — as much an externality as the extractive labor conditions that made the screen you’re using right now to read this article.As numerous journalists on the electronics supply chain beat have documented, those extractive conditions can have devastating consequences. Don’t the materials, manufacturing, and waste management concerns that go into any large-scale humanoid robot future deserve similar scrutiny? While mass-manufacture of humanoid robots may not be a current or even near-future development, given the tendency of tech companies to treat dystopian literature as a VC pitch deck, it’s reasonable to assume someone will try to pull it off. And the persistent appeal of the humanoid robot as a fictional trope in part relies on ignoring its massive resource requirements. Once those costs are laid bare, the less philosophically ponderous rationales for making humanoid robots become a lot harder to ignore. Extrapolating on the supply chains required for science fiction’s visions of a world of sentient humanoid robots offers a more complex perspective on A.I. ethics and the sheer impracticality of engineering cybernetic organisms in the first place.One would hope they’d stick to using medical-grade silicone blends, but in a scenario with multiple competing robot vendors, we may not be so lucky.Of course, there isn’t just one kind of sci-fi robot design. Fictional humanoid robots tend to run a spectrum from fully mechanical (Ava in Ex Machina, the Stepford Wives, the synthetics of the Alien franchise) to fully bioengineered (replicants in Blade Runner and, depending on how you want to classify him, the Creature in Frankenstein). Cybernetic hybrids made of organic tissue and mechanical/electronic components (Terminators, Westworld’s hosts, the “skinjob” Cylons of Battlestar Galactica) that sit somewhere in between the mechanical and the biological are also popular. There’s also a spectrum of manufacturing scales—many of pop fiction’s humanoid machines are relatively bespoke high-end products or prototypes, not necessarily mass-manufactured.Starting with just looking at the mechanical/biological distinction, let’s take a look at some of the extractive and materials requirements, maintenance, and end-of-life-cycle needs of humanoid robots.On the fully mechanical end of the spectrum, the materials required for making a humanoid robot aren’t all that different from what’s used to make humanoid robots today: circuits, armature, actuators, an energy source, and, at minimum, a sleeve of material resembling human skin to contain all the electronic components. Sometimes you’ll also get a wig of hair. Hanson Robotics, the creators of Sophia the robot, is perhaps the most well-known company working on building humanlike robots. Sophia’s skin suit is made of a patented material Hanson calls Frubber, but unfortunately the company would not respond to a request for an interview, so we can’t know, exactly, what it’s made from. We can, however, read Hanson’s patent for a “human emulation robot system,” which suggests Frubber may not be all that different from existing elastomers (elastic polymers) on the market. The patent cites products from casting materials companies like BJB and Smooth-On, and the text notes that “any suitable elastomer may be used for the skin, such as Thermoplastic, Silicone, Polyvinyl, Polyethylene, Polyurethane [or] Polyolefin.” While not all polymers are directly derived from petroleum, petrochemicals and natural gas tend to play some role in the creation of these compounds.Since I couldn’t get my hands on any Frubber, I decided to look at other industries trying to replicate skin-feel. This is how I ended up ordering a skin-tone sample set from Real Doll, proprietors of one of the higher-end sex dolls on the market. (My verdict: definitely “fleshy” in terms of density and elasticity, but more on the Gak side of the texture spectrum than actual skin.) Although Hanson Robotics doesn’t directly cite the sex toy industry in its approach to making artificial skin, the company is likely indirectly indebted to a long line of innovations in fuckable products.As Hallie Lieberman, author of Buzz: A Stimulating History of the Sex Toy, observed in a phone interview, “Anytime we come up with new materials, we have a sex toy that comes along soon after.” Materials science innovations, from Bakelite to silicone, tended to be rapidly seized upon by sex toy manufacturers that were attempting to create products that felt not only good but also “lifelike,” or at least were advertised as such. According to its FAQ section, Real Doll’s silicone blend includes “a harmless oil suspended between the molecules of silicone, which gives the flesh a more realistic feel and greater elasticity” (this may have produced the Gak-like stickiness of my sample set) and, given proper care and maintenance, can continue to be used for at least a decade.Leaping to use the latest new castable materials also led to major health and safety issues in sex toy manufacturing, since the inventors of, say, polyvinyl chloride weren’t necessarily thinking about whether people could safely insert that material into their body. As Lieberman notes, “The sex toy industry isn’t really regulated the way medical devices are,” which means consumers can be at risk of exposure to toxic chemicals like phthalates if they’re not buying from a reputable vendor. Additionally, sex doll owners sometimes tend to do maintenance and repairs to the dolls themselves using consumer silicone mold-making materials, and they may not know to look for medical-grade material. If we’re assuming a future in which a monopoly corporation is selling humanoid robots, one would hope they’d stick to using medical-grade silicone blends, but in a scenario with multiple competing robot vendors, we may not be so lucky.E-waste could be a less dire problem for robot hardware than it is for smartphones and AirPods.Underneath the synthetic skin, hardware supply chains for the fictional cyborg likely wouldn’t differ all that much from those underlying today’s consumer electronics — materials like lithium, cobalt, graphene, neodymium, silicon, tantalum, copper, and aluminum would need to be mined, processed, and fabricated into robot components. Considering the approximate amount of ore that has to be mined just to make an iPhone, scaling up to a full humanoid form would likely require a lot more extraction. Assuming demand for electric vehicles, weapons, and personal electronic devices increases alongside the emerging robot economy, this could create a serious commodities challenge — not to mention some massive ecological destruction (assuming we’re not simultaneously weighing the materials costs of creating an asteroid mining industry, which offers a whole new set of supply chain challenges).Depending on the design of the robot and the business model of robot manufacturers, e-waste could be a less dire problem for robot hardware than it is for smartphones and AirPods. Part of the challenge of recycling consumer electronics for smelting comes down to size and design choices, like making lithium batteries harder to remove. Larger components, like an endoskeleton, might therefore be easier to smelt.Recycling looks a little more complicated for sex toys and dolls. Most of the polymers used in making sex toys aren’t biodegradable, though there is at least one vendor currently using biodegradable PLA. There also isn’t much vertical integration for taking products back and reusing or recycling components, leading to yet more plastic in the waste stream and, apparently, oceans.So, before we even get into the computational and engineering labor required to make a sentient A.I., it should be noted that building a world of widespread mechanical humanoid robots would require tremendous amounts of fossil fuel extraction. There are complex polymers to mimic human skin and mineral extraction for components, and these robots may or may not bear some serious health risks depending on whether vendors are considering if people are going to try to fuck the robots. (Of course people will try to fuck the robots.)But it’s not clear that switching out synthetic polymers of our Stepford Wives for synthetic biology of our replicants would make for a less resource-intensive android supply chain.Neonatal foreskin is one of the most commonly used sources for generating human skin in the lab, but no one in my reporting seemed able to point me to the vendor who “just does foreskin.”While the key materials of tissue engineering, like scaffolding, cells, and nutrient sources to help the cells grow, technically don’t need to be mined from the earth, they do have to come from somewhere. For example, when it comes to generating human skin—a practice currently used in burn grafting and for more niche lab applications, like cosmetics testing—you need collagen and fibroblast cells. Bovine collagen is typically extracted as part of the end process of livestock slaughter via a hydrolysis process used to turn cow hides into leather. Rat tail tendons, presumably obtained from deceased lab rats, are also a common collagen source. But if you’re looking for human sources of collagen, the supply chain gets a bit murkier. Neonatal foreskin is one of the most commonly used sources for generating human skin in the lab. No one in my reporting seemed able to point me to the vendor who “just does foreskin,” but most likely it involves recovering materials that would otherwise end up in medical waste streams.We won’t need to have an endless supply of foreskins at the ready to build a bioengineered robot army: Cells replicate, and you can get a lot of engineered skin from one foreskin. (A commonly cited and nightmare-inducing estimate from a 1998 journal article is five to six football fields’ worth.) Israeli firm CollPlant has genetically engineered tobacco plants that produce human collagen, so maybe we could skip the foreskins altogether. It’s impractical to keep football field–sized blankets of human skin lying around in storage, and technology already exists for creating spray-on skin for burn victims, so in all likelihood the addition of a skin layer could be an on-demand final touch for our humanoid robots.But the kind of tissue generated for grafts and research is a really superficial layer of what constitutes “skin.” “Full-thickness skin is a fairly complex organ that needs to be layered in a very specific way,” says Oron Catts, director of SymbioticA, a lab at the University of Western Australia dedicated to artistic explorations of life sciences. With collaborator Ionat Zurr, Catts has been using tissue engineering as an artistic medium for more than 20 years, which has given him more than enough time to become skeptical of some of the visions of fully bioengineered living forms as a more environmentally friendly or efficient approach.“When engineering tissue, you’re essentially outsourcing the body of the organism to technology,” Catts says. “You need to predigest all of the nutrients. You need to protect it from infection. You need to do all of the things that a body does by itself.” All these activities have their own energy and resource costs, and the hardware and equipment used in that process is as much a product of extractive industries as our mechanical humanoid robots.On top of the lab costs, there’s the work that goes into making it possible to take your cybernetic organism out of the lab. “If you bring a completely manufactured living system into this world, it’s going to deal with all the living systems we take for granted, like bacteria and parasites,” says Jeremiah Johnston, programs director at cellular agriculture nonprofit New Harvest. Westworld briefly acknowledged this reality in its first season with a reference to host Maeve getting an MRSA infection, but host immunology hasn’t really come up since in the series. While Johnston speculates that there are ways of constructing safeguards for your bioengineered robots — some careful engineering of major histocompatibility complex proteins, borrowing from fungus or soil bacteria biology and making cells that basically “pump out antibiotics,” perhaps — there’s so much about biomes that we don’t understand and can’t control for once we step outside of a lab. In Johnston’s words, “Biology works because you create more disorder than the order you’re trying to create.” The bioengineered robot vendor, in other words, is going to have a hell of a time with quality assurance and maintenance.While the waste streams of bioengineered robots might not hold toxic minerals, there are still toxic components to be reckoned with.“Waste is essentially unavoidable” in living systems, as Johnston points out. Whether that waste looks like the watered-down urea produced in human waste or is engineered into a slightly less toxic form by borrowing from other species (do Westworld hosts actually produce birdlike white shit? We’ve never seen them pooping!), there’s always going to be some waste stream to reckon with. And as far as recycling components goes, there are possibilities of using some bioengineered components as scaffolding for new tissue, but a circular economy approach to cybernetic organisms is unlikely. “The only form of recycling is compost,” Catts jokes.If you trace the supply chain requirements and hypothetical life cycles of humanoid robots, it begins to make sense why a lot of the examples from popular science fiction tend to be highly niche, high-end models: Actually doing it at scale would be incredibly resource intensive and expensive.They’re also impractical for a lot of industrial applications. A warehouse robot that lifts and moves pallets doesn’t need convincing skin so much as it needs to be good at perceiving space and have at least one very strong lifting arm. And as the wide world of sex toy design demonstrates, anthropomorphism in devices isn’t a fundamental utility.Janet Lieberman Lu, CTO and CPO of distinctly not-anthropomorphic sex toy company Dame Products, wrote via email when asked about utility and anthropomorphism in sex toys, “Penises are great, but they’re overconstrained in their design.” Rather than produce a simulacra for sexual pleasure, Dame’s products try to, in Lieberman Lu’s words, “enhance what the human body can already do.” And while Lieberman Lu discouraged stigmatizing sex doll users, she also expressed skepticism of sci-fi narratives around sex robots. “No one should be worried that 20 or 50 years from now, they’ll have replaced all human sexual interaction,” she says. “If that were true, they’d already be more popular.”Hallie Lieberman, the sex toy historian, noted that within both sci-fi narratives and the niche world of sex dolls, the goal of “can we create the perfect person” tends to actually translate to “can we create an artificial thing that (usually) looks like a woman,” and perfection typically has more to do with control than creativity. Despite all the rhetorical blather about consciousness and selfhood, ultimately most narratives around building a humanoid robot aren’t actually about making a machine — a thing — that’s exactly like a person; they’re about responding to a frustration that people can’t be — and can’t be treated — more like things. And while the A.I. supply chains of real life may lack in synthetic skin and immune system design challenges, the goal of making human beings into disposable and easily controlled components arguably persists.When it comes to forecasting the future of A.I., most experts today go to great eye-rolling pains to emphasize it won’t look like the Terminator or any of the humanoid robots of cinema. Based on the resource needs of those futures, they’re probably correct — filling the world with robot-humans would have a massive environmental impact and limited returns on investment. Then again, impracticality and environmental damage across the supply chain hasn’t stopped a lot of technological development. There are plenty of people who “just buy cobalt,” “just train the model,” or “just manage the data centers” that consume vast amounts of energy, reproduce structural biases, and further alienate and displace human labor. It wouldn’t be a stretch for the market to offer a niche for someone who just does eyes.Update: A previous version of this article misstated Janet Lieberman Lu’s first name. It has been corrected.Written by"
