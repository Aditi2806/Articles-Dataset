0,9 Tips For Training Lightning-Fast Neural Networks In Pytorch,"Let’s face it, your model is probably still stuck in the stone age. I bet you’re still using 32bit precision or *GASP* perhaps even training only on a single GPU.😱.I get it though, there are 99 speed-up guides but a checklist ain’t 1? (yup, that just happened). Well, consider this the ultimate, step-by-step guide to making sure you’re squeezing all the (GP-Use) 😂 out of your model.This guide is structured from simplest to most PITA modifications you can make to get the most out of your network. I’ll show example Pytorch code and the related flags you can use in the Pytorch-Lightning Trainer in case you don’t feel like coding these yourself!Who is this guide for? Anyone working on non-trivial deep learning models in Pytorch such as industrial researchers, Ph.D. students, academics, etc… The models we’re talking about here might be taking you multiple days to train or even weeks or months.We’ll cover (from simplest to most PITA)You can find every optimization I discuss here in the Pytorch library called Pytorch-Lightning. Lightning is a light wrapper on top of Pytorch that automates training for researchers while giving them full control of the critical model parts. Check out this tutorial for a more robust example.Lightning uses the latest best practices and minimizes the places where you can make a mistake.We’ll define our LightningModel for MNIST here and fit using the Trainer.This is probably the easiest place to get some speed gains. The days of saving h5py or numpy files to speed up your data loading are gone (wait… you guys weren’t doing that?? ). With Pytorch dataloader loading image data is trivial (for NLP data, check out TorchText)In lightning you don’t need to specify a training loop, just define the dataLoaders and the Trainer will call them when needed.Another magical place for speed-up comes from allowing batches to be loaded in parallel. So instead of loading one batch at a time, you can load nb_workers batches at a time.Before starting the next optimization steps, crank up the batch size to as much as your CPU-RAM or GPU-RAM will allow.The next sections will focus on helping decrease the RAM footprint so you can continue to increase the batch size.Remember you’ll likely have to update your learning-rate again. A good rule of thumb is to double learning rate if you double batch size.In the case where you have maxed out your compute resources, and your batch size is still too low (say 8), then we need to simulate a larger batch size for gradient descent to provide a good estimate.Let’s say we want to get to a batch size of 128. Then we’ll do 16 forward and backward passes with a batch-size of 8 before doing a single optimizer step.In lightning, this is all done for you though. Just set this flag.A simple place to blow up your RAM is not releasing the pointer to the computational graph by say… storing your loss for logging purposesThe problem above is that loss still has a copy of the graph. In this case, call .item() to release it.Lightning takes special care to make sure it never retains copy of the graph (here’s an example).Once you’ve maxed out the previous steps, it’s time to move into GPU training. Training on the GPU will parallelize the mathematical computations across the many GPU cores. The speed-up you get depends on the type of GPU you’re using. I recommend the 2080Ti for personal use and the V100 for corporate use.It may seem overwhelming at first but you really only need to do two things: 1) move your model to the GPU, 2) whenever you run data through it, put the data on the GPU.If you’re using Lightning, you don’t have to do anything to your code. Just set this flag:The main thing to take care of when training on GPUs is to limit the number of transfers between CPU and GPU.If you run out of RAM for example, don’t move data back to the CPU to save RAM. Try to optimize your code in other ways or distribute across GPUs before resorting to that.Another thing to watch out for is calling operations which force the GPUs to synchronize. An example would be clearing the memory cache.If you use Lightning, however, the only places this could be an issue are when you define your Lightning Module. Lightning takes special care to not make these kinds of mistakes.Sixteen-bit precision is an amazing hack to cut your memory footprint in half. The majority of models are trained using 32-bit precision numbers. However, recent research has found that models can work just as well with 16-bit. Mixed-precision means you use 16-bit for certain things but keep things like weights at 32-bit.To use 16-bit precision in Pytorch, install the apex library from NVIDIA and make these changes to your model.The amp package will take care of most things for you. It’ll even scale the loss if the gradients explode or go to zero.In lightning, it’s trivial to enable 16-bit without having to modify anything in your model or do what I wrote above.Now, this is where things get really interesting. There are 3 (maybe more?) ways of doing multi-GPU training.Split-batch TrainingThe first way should just be called split-batch training. This strategy copies the model onto each GPU and each GPU gets a portion of the batch.In lightning, you can just increase the number of GPUs you tell the trainer about without having to do anything of the above.Split Model TrainingSometimes your model can be too big too fit in memory. For example a sequence to sequence model with an encoder and a decoder might take up 20 GB of RAM when generating outputs. In this case, we want to put the encoder and decoder on separate GPUs.For this type of training, don’t give Lightning trainer any GPUs. Instead, put your own modules in the LightningModule on the correct GPUMixing bothIn the case above, both the encoders and decoders can still benefit from parallelizing each operation. We can get more creative now.Caveats to think about when using multiple GPUsIf you’ve made it this far, you’re now in the realm of training Imagenet in minutes! This isn’t as hard as you might think, but it might require a bit more knowledge about your compute cluster. These instructions assume you’re using SLURM on your cluster.Pytorch allows multi-node training by copying the model on each GPU across every node and syncing the gradients. So, each model is initialized independently on each GPU and in essence trains independently on a partition of the data, except they all receive gradient updates from all models.At a high-level:Pytorch has a nice abstraction called DistributedDataParallel which can do this for you. To use DDP you need to do 4 things:Pytorch team has a nice tutorial to see this in full detail.However, in Lightning, this comes out of the box for you. Just set the number of nodes flag and it takes care of the rest for you.Lightning also comes with a SlurmCluster manager to easily help you submit the correct details for the SLURM job (example).Turns out, that the distributedDataParallel is soooo much faster than DataParallel because the only communication it performs is gradient syncing. So, a good hack is to replace DataParallel with this even when training on a single machineIn Lightning, this is easy to achieve by setting the distributed_backend to ddp and setting the number of GPUs.Although this guide will give you a list of tricks to speed up your networks, I’ll explain how I think through finding bottlenecks.I break up the model into a few parts:First, I make sure I have no bottlenecks in my data loading. For this I use existing data loading solutions I described, but if none fit what you need, think about offline processing and caching into high-performance data-stores such as h5py.Next look at what you’re doing in the training step. Make sure your forward pass is fast, avoid excessive computations and minimize data transfer between CPU and GPU. Finally, avoid doing things to slow down the GPU (covered in this guide)Next, I try to maximize my batch size which will usually be bounded by the amount of GPU memory. From there it’s a game about distributing across GPUs while minimizing latency to effectively use a large batch size (for instance on Imagenet I might try to get an effective batch size of 8,000+ across many GPUs.)However, you need to be careful with large batch sizes. Consult the literature for your specific problem to see what people have gotten away with!AcknowledgmentsThank you to Jeff Johnson for awesome CUDA insights, and the Pytorch teams for their help with getting DDP to work (not to mention their awesome framework and documentation).

1,How To Become A One-Drink Wonder,"By Lauren BravoSo you managed to take a little time off drinking! Congrats! Strike up the band! Lie on the floor and let someone pour Malbec into your mouth through a funnel!But then what? Once the first hangover has cleared, what’s going to be the legacy of your abstinence?You may not want to go completely teetotal, but you also know you don’t want to slide straight back into your old habits either. Because what’s the point of surviving days of dusty sobriety if you aren’t going to make long-term change? You’d like to get a handle on your drinking before everybody else quietly gives up and you’re the only boozer under 40 left.On the one hand, life is short. But on the other… same. It’s quite a conundrum.The answer? My friend, you need to become a One-Drink Wonder. An ODW, as the cool Bumble bios will read one day.Not to sound too much like I’m recruiting for a cult, but I’ve been an ODW for years now and I’m here to tell you it’s possible — to go out, even out-out, have one drink and stop. It’s hard, but you can do it. It takes practice, sure; but then so did liking the taste of tequila.“If you are trying to drink less overall, then alcohol-free days are actually easier than the days when you just have one or two drinks — for the simple reason that self-control and decision-making skills often go out of the window after a couple of drinks,” says Rosamund Dean, author of Mindful Drinking: How Cutting Down Can Change Your Life. She’s right of course; once you’re in the pub or at the party, it can feel as though resistance is futile. Lead a horse to water, and you might as well make it a double.For those of us who live on a feast-or-famine seesaw, always either on the wagon or crashing dramatically off it, a balanced middle ground is the holy grail. Having one drink might not sound thrilling, but it gives you options between ‘on for a rager’ and ‘home on the sofa’. You don’t have to sacrifice your Saturday morning for the sake of Friday night. You can join in the fun and remember it afterwards. Trust me, I’m a lightweight.In the interests of transparency I should say that I’m a One-Drink Wonder by accident, not through iron-willed self-restraint. I became one at the age of 22, when horrible hangovers started to massively eclipse my enjoyment, and it’s taken until my 30s for my feeble alcohol tolerance to be seen as a special skill rather than a massive deficiency.But now, finally, people want to know the secret. And I’ve learned a few things in all my years of “Honestly, I’m fine with this lukewarm water!” and “No you were really funny last night, promise!” that I’d like to share, backed up with sound advice from some experts.Here are 10 steps to help you become a One-Drink Wonder. I only hope this goes some way to compensating for all the rounds I haven’t bought.This advice is designed for people looking to cut down their alcohol intake, not those concerned they have a serious alcohol problem. If you are worried about your drinking, please contact Alcohol Change UK or Drinkline on 0300 123 1110.1. Water, water everywhereThis is the most annoying advice, so we’ll deal with it first. Water. You know this. For god’s sake, water.More specifically, drink water before anything else. We all know the old adage about alternating booze with soft drinks — but realistically this just means you end up sloshing around with a liquid belly, tripping balls on sugar and caffeine. Instead, I find it’s more helpful to co-opt the Instagram coffee mantra: “But first, water.” When the waiter comes round for the drinks orders, have a water before you reach for the wine list. When you finally choose a picnic spot on a blistering hot bank holiday, drain a bottle of water before you open that cold, cold beer. Always deal with your thirst first. It rhymes so it must be true.2. Patience, child“For those who drink impulsively to soothe social anxiety, boredom or stress, I suggest creating a window of time between wanting to drink and actually drinking,” says Shahroo Izadi, behavioural change specialist and author of The Kindness Method: Changing Habits for Good.She recommends telling yourself that you can drink whatever you want, but in an hour’s time. “Not only does this reinforce that thoughts are alerts, not commands and that ultimately we are in control of our actions, but it buys you an hour when you’d otherwise be drinking.”3. Get your plan in place“It may sound boring but the better you plan for the obstacles that come your way, the more likely you are to succeed,” says Laura Willoughby MBE, cofounder of mindful drinking movement Club Soda. “It helps to use a tool like ‘WOOP’ — wish, outcome, obstacle, plan — before you hit the bar. Knowing why you are sticking at one or two drinks (your wish, and outcome) will help keep you motivated, and planning for the point where people encourage you to stay for one more (the obstacle) will mean you know what you will do instead with confidence.”So have your official speech prepared in advance — whether it’s “I have to get up early” or “I recently discovered I have a rare condition where a second beer could make my head explode.”4. Go hard, then go homeMy breakthrough moment as a One-Drink Wonder was learning to like the strongest, bitterest thing on the menu. If you’re naturally sweet-toothed this can take practice, much like training yourself to drink black coffee or liquidised kale — but while it might seem counterintuitive when you’re trying to cut down, hard liquor is this ODW’s secret weapon.For one thing, a punchy drink commands respect from a certain breed of dickhead; the kind who always refuses to order you a shandy, believing it to be charming banter. In an ideal world, the dickheads wouldn’t bother us. But in this world, sometimes it’s helpful to keep them at bay.For another thing, stronger drinks should last longer. It’s so much easier to slowly sip a negroni or a nice single malt over the course of an hour than it is to drain a G&T and not immediately want another one. It feels grown-up, wincing slightly at every swig like a 1940s detective.And finally, when you’ve paid a tenner for your drink, you should want to make every drop count. Woe betide the barman who clears my glass when there’s still a 50p dribble in the bottom.5. Quality over quantityA swish drink can also help you feel less deprived. “If I’m going out and I want to make sure I only have one or two drinks, I choose the nicest (most spenny) drink I can,” says Rosamund. “So I’ll have a glass of champagne, rather than prosecco. Or I’ll have the nicest red wine on the menu. Or maybe a martini, which I will sip and savour.”After all, cheap drinks are a false economy once you factor in the Uber home. And the Domino’s.6. Eating isn’t cheatingThis isn’t an ironclad rule, because ironclad rules rarely do anybody any good. But as a mere suggestion: don’t drink through dinner. Unless you’re in a tasting-menu-with-wine-pairings situation, truth is you might appreciate both the food and the booze more if you keep them separate. The chef didn’t toil over the flavour profile of each dish only to have you souse your tastebuds in house white.So have a drink before dinner, enjoy it, then say, “I’ll have another one afterwards.” It’s amazing how often ‘afterwards’ rolls around and you’re too full and happy to bother.7. Not sharing is caringWe’re lone wolves, the One-Drink Wonders. We march to the beat of our own bottle opener. And because there’s nothing more likely to make you drink more than you wanted to drink than paying more than you wanted to pay, ODWs don’t do sharing, or rounds.This is easier said than done, of course. We’ve all felt pressured into ordering a bottle in a fit of jolly camaraderie. But while being the “actually I’ll just have a glass” person can make you feel like a killjoy, it can also break the spell and allow everyone else to be honest about what they really want, too. Rosamund says: “I’ll tell my friends at the beginning of the night: ‘I’m only having one tonight, so think I’ll make it a martini.’ Often, you’ll be surprised how keen they are to do the same.”8. Hack yourself soberForgive me if this sounds a bit Silicon Valley, but: rather than thinking of cutting down your drinking as an exercise in self-denial, try to think of it as a positive modification. You’re applying booze carefully and cleverly, to get the best results.“See it as an opportunity to actually ‘optimise’ your drinking experience as opposed to controlling or punishing yourself,” explains Shahroo. “Some of my clients who have experience of taking drugs (such as ecstasy) in the past actually find it easier to learn to moderate their drinking by remembering that alcohol is a drug and they want to be enjoying the positive effects for as long as possible. This tends to mean they drink more slowly and in smaller amounts, to maintain the buzz that they most enjoy. They simply drink until they are feeling the benefits and either slow right down or stop entirely when they’ve reached that sweet spot.”9. Practice makes perfect“Most of us want to moderate because we can’t imagine not drinking at a club, with a meal or at a friend’s birthday. But until you have done some of those occasions without a drink in hand you will never know what it feels like and if it is possible,” says Laura. “Set yourself some missions to do some big nights out without drinking, and develop the skills to really pick and choose.”Once you’ve danced sober, dated sober, even survived a hen weekend sober (dare you), settling for just the one drink will feel like a better compromise. And as Rosamund points out, “If you are drinking less overall, you’ll find that all it takes is one or two drinks to get you nicely buzzy.”10. Tell yourself you can still get trashed from time to timeIf the idea of never being more than “nicely buzzy” again feels unspeakably dull, earmark the occasional future sesh in your diary, as a treat. On those nights you might say yes to a second, and a third, and a sixth, but only if and when you really want to. After all, as Oscar Wilde once wrote on a fridge magnet, everything in moderation. Including moderation.Originally published at https://www.refinery29.com.Written by"
2,Treat Yourself Like a CEO and You’ll Make 10x More Income,"As I wrote that headline, an old joke came to mind:A guy walks into his office wearing a full-on Spiderman costume.“Hey Dave, what’s with the costume?” his coworker asks.“You know what they say,” Dave responds: “Dress for the job you want, not the job you have.”Walking around as if you make 6-figures a year when you really make $10/hour won’t magically make you rich. (It’ll probably make you look like a moron.)This isn’t some feel-goody-fluff article about being positive. I tried being “positive” for a long time working dead-end jobs and being completely broke and unemployed, and it didn’t work at all.But when you treat yourself fundamentally different than you have before — really treating yourself differently — then yes, you can expect to see some significant changes in your income.The reason is simple: people respect genuine self-belief. You teach people how to treat you.If you let people know that you’re not someone who tolerates mediocrity, they’ll stop giving you mediocre opportunities. When you tell people that you only accept truly great opportunities, that’s what you’ll start to attract. You attract what you are — make sure you‘re attracting the right things.If you want to be something, then act like it.If you don’t want to be something, then stop acting like that thing.Tony Robbins once asked a crowd of thousands to imagine their door bell ringing. When they opened the door, he told them a “depressed person” was at the door.He then asked them to describe that person.The answers? Probably similar to yours: drooped shoulders, downcast, messy hair, a frown, a quiet voice, no eye contact.Then he asked them to imagine that a “happy person” rang the doorbell. What did that person look like?Big smile. Friendly eyes. Warm handshake. Raised chin, standing tall. Eye contact.Robbins then asked everyone to physically imitate “a depressed person” and “a happy person” for one minute — act “depressed” and act “happy.” Robbins asked them how they felt afterwards.The answer: it had a huge effect! Even a minute of acting like a “depressed person” made many people actually feel sad and helpless.Of course, this is very oversimplified — real Depression and anxiety are enormous, complicated issues that can’t just be “thought” away. But I’m trying to make a point:How you act determines how you are.In his autobiography, Arnold Schwarzenegger wrote:The only way you become a leading man is to treat yourself like a leading man, and work your ass off.When I first started writing, I treated myself like a completely amateur writer. I didn’t invest in any tools or training, I wrote inconsistently, and didn’t focus on providing any real value. As a result, I never made any progress.Years passed. Finally, I started treating myself like a true professional. I did what professional writers were doing — investing in themselves, experimenting, learning new skills, failing forward.So I started making serious investments in like myself, like buying a $500 writing course and reading dozens of books. I also started writing consistently, and focused on learning and creating, not entertainment. I tried new things. I ignored the mean comments and kept writing.Treating myself like a professional writer has gotten me enormous results. The other day, I emailed a best-selling author to ask for a book endorsement — because why not? They responded, and they’re endorsing my book!!Treat yourself like a professional. If you want be something, then act like it.“Pretend your time is worth $1,000/hr. Would you spend five of them doing extra work for free? Would you waste one on being angry?” -Niklas GökeYou have very few hours here on on this earth.Still, many people waste much of their time on pointless, low-quality activities that don’t help them reach their true goals — their mission.The truth is, most people value their time at far, far less than it’s worth.They say yes to things they have no business doing. They give away their talents, attention, and effort to others who take, take, take.They spend hours watching low-quality television and social media when they should be productive and effective.See, many people could be making a fortune (if they used their time well)…but instead, they give away their time in unproductive ways that leave them broke, unhappy, and stuck.But what if you placed a high value on your time?How would that change you? Your life? Your family? Your future?Imagine that an hour of your time is worth $1,000.What would your life look like?What people would you stop putting up with?What problems would you stop wasting time on?What things would you stop — and start — doing?Your results would be incredible. You’d become exponentially more productive, focused, and effective.“Most people have no clue what they are doing with their time but still complain that they don’t have enough.” -Grant Cardone, NYT best-selling authorLike I said, I spent years in writing mediocrity. Nobody read my stuff…because my stuff sucked. I didn’t invest any time or money into making myself better. Deep down, I knew I wasn’t a “professional.” So I treated myself like an amateur.Finally, I started taking myself seriously. And everything has changed since then.I get requests to be interviewed on podcasts, magazines, and blogs. The other day, I was asked to be a paid speaker at an international conference. Readers email me all the time telling me how helpful my content has been for them.Most days, I still have a hard time believing this is my life. Because for years, I was the one desperately begging people to notice me and my writing. No one ever did…until I started taking myself seriously.I don’t know exactly what will happen in your life when you start taking yourself seriously. But I can tell you this:Your life will change. And if you’re like me, any upgrade looks fantastic when you’ve spent years trying to make it.You teach people how to treat you.If you let people know your time is free and low-valued, people will treat it as such.But if you teach people that your time is expensive, important, and valuable, then people will respond in kind.What you think is what you become. If you think your time is worth a few bucks an hour, that you’ll begin to act like it. You’ll find yourself saying “yes” to meaningless, pointless obligations.But if, in your heart, you know your time is valuable…People will recognize that.People will respect that.People will treat you differently.Wrote author William Irvine:“People are unhappy in large part because they are confused about what is valuable.”Michael Jordan once said:You have to expect things of yourself before you can do them.If you believe you can can, odds are you probably will.But the opposite is also true — if you know you can’t, you’re probably right.Bruce Lee put it this way: “One will never get any more than he thinks he can get.” What you truly, deeply believe is true about yourself and your future is most likely what will happen.What do you believe?The problem is, most people don’t have powerful self-belief in themselves. Most people think this is about as good as it gets. For the most part, most people believe the best they can be is merely “good.”Why? Because it’s easier to stay in mediocrity than undertake the difficult process of upgrading your belief system. It’s easier to relax in “good” instead of busting your ass towards greatness.If you want to have an incredible, successful life, you need to begin believing success is the only possible option.If you want to increase your income, you should go to the source — you and your mindset. You can’t control customers, hiring managers, or people around you; you can control yourself and what you believe about yourself. All action stems from your belief. If deep down, you don’t think you can ever achieve true greatness…you almost certainly won’t.Upgrade your beliefs. Start treating yourself like a true professional. Start treating yourself seriously — you can be a force to be reckoned with, if you let yourself become that person.Once you start treating yourself like something bigger than you are now — a millionaire, a CEO, or whatever your goal is — you make that possibility much more real. Because you teach people how to treat you — start treating yourself like the thing you want to become.If you want to become extraordinary and become 10x more effective than you were before, check out my checklist.Click here to get the checklist now!Written by"
3,Bored? 7 Fun Things You Can Build,"There is no real secret when it comes to becoming a great developer. The thing that separates great developers from mediocre developers is the effort they’ve put in. Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts. Getting your hands dirty is what will make you grow as a developer.So while you’re on your way to becoming a fantastic developer, why not do it making something that’s actually fun to build?What’s fun to build? You’ve probably thought about this for a while. You want to build something but you don’t know what…well, let me help you out.In this piece, I’ll share seven projects with you that are both challenging and fun.This is a project I’ve been wanting to work on for myself for quite some time. When developing, I spend a lot of my time on web development. But software development is just so much more! If you like the combination of software and hardware this project is for you.This project aims to water your plants automatically. All you need for this is an Arduino (or Raspberry Pi), a moisture sensor, and a water pump. The goal is to write a piece of code that keeps your plants alive for as long as possible.What you’ll learn:Building Tetris is a great way to get a feeling of how games are developed from a basic perspective. If you want to make an app you could use Swift for this project. If you want to make this using HTML5, you could go for a JavaScript framework, like React or Vue.Things you’ll learn:Find the example GitHub repository here.Cryptocurrency has been a hot topic for a few years now. Despite this, there still aren’t many developers capable of writing smart contracts.Many blockchains that use smart contracts — the Ethereum blockchain currently being the biggest of them. The programming language that’s used for these Ethereum smart contracts is called Solidity.To get started with writing a smart contract you could start with a smart contract that sends transactions. If you want a more advanced smart contract, you could make one that functions as an escrow.What you’ll learn:You can find a great starting point for Solidity here.If you are new to the world of machine learning, then the classification of iris flowers is a great way to get a grasp of what machine learning is all about. That’s because this project is known as the “Hello World” of machine learning projects.The aim of this project is to classify iris flowers among three species (setosa, versicolor or virginica) based on measurements of length and width of sepals and petals. This project is perfectly suited being made in Python. All you need to get started is the data set.What you’ll learn:If you’re not the type of person that likes doing solo projects, you could always choose to contribute to open source. It might seem scary at first sight but there are lots of projects that could use a little help.If you don’t feel comfortable enough to submit pieces of code, that’s fine. Contributing can be as simple as checking a pull request.Pick a project you like and start helping people out!Here’s a good starting point if you want to contribute to an open-source project on GitHub.What you’ll learn:Creating your own trading algorithm is a project that requires a lot of finetuning. But before you can start building your algorithm you should do some research on trading strategies. Once you’ve got your strategy figured out, you can use a free stock API, like IEX Cloud, to check current the prices of your stocks.Let the algorithm run for some time and see how it performs. There are plenty of stock simulators you can use that will let you play with virtual cash instead of real cash.What you’ll learn:There are lots of out-of-the-box projects available when it comes to dashboards — but nothing’s as fun as building your own!This is one of the easier projects from this list. Very useful for developers who are just starting out. You can make this in basic HTML5 and CSS but if you want to go the extra mile, add React or Vue into the mix.What you’ll learn:It’s time to do some real work and have fun while you learn new things. These projects should keep you busy for quite some time. Picked one and just go for it!I would love giving you feedback on your project — I’m looking forward to seeing the results.If you can’t have fun, there’s no sense in doing it — Paul WalkerHappy coding!Written by"
4,First AI Model of the Universe Knows Science it was Never Taught,"A new 3D model of the Universe developed by an international team of researchers is fast, accurate, and makes predictions for which it was never programmed. Creators of the system have no idea how the Deep Density Displacement Model (D3M) is able to simulate changes in dark matter it was never taught to calculate.Artificial intelligence (AI) is modeling astronomical events from supernova explosions to the formation of exoplanets around alien stars. Now, researchers are harnessing the power of AI to model the Universe as a whole, with surprising results. As expected, the model quickly proved itself to be faster and more accurate than previous systems. However, without human operators training D3M to do so, the AI proved itself capable of describing models of the Universe with varying degrees of dark matter, baffling researchers.“It’s like teaching image recognition software with lots of pictures of cats and dogs, but then it’s able to recognize elephants. Nobody knows how it does this, and it’s a great mystery to be solved,” stated Shirley Ho, group leader at the Flatiron Institute’s Center for Computational Astrophysics and adjunct professor at Carnegie Mellon University.Our compliments to the M-5 unitOf the four fundamental forces of nature (gravity, electromagnetic, strong and weak forces), gravity plays the largest role, by far, in interactions between distant objects. Therefore, researchers developing the D3M system directed its focus to the effects of gravity on the Universe.Such models can require researchers to run thousands of simulations, and the most accurate models examine how billions of bodies behave over the age of the Universe.Investigators provided D3M with 8,000 of the most accurate simulations ever created. Neural networks ran calculations on the data, and researchers compared those results to their expected results.Following this training, D3M ran simulations on the behavior of virtual galaxies within a box measuring 600 million light years per side. While traditional faster models produce data in two to three minutes to complete, and more detailed scenarios take hundreds of hours to produce a result, D3M completed its task in less than 1/30th of a second.Faster models typically produce an error rate around 9.3 percent when compared to the best known results. In comparison, this new system produced a model with an error rate of a mere 2.8 percent.Researchers expected the speed and accuracy of their system to exceed that of previous models. What they did not expect was the AI to be able to carry out scenarios in which it had no training.Modeling the behavior of vast numbers of galaxies requires extraordinary computing power, and detailed simulations can take days to complete. Faster simulations, able to return results in a matter of minutes, lack some of the detail and accuracy possible with older, slower, models.The D3M model developed scenarios far more accurate than other models of the gravitational effect of gravity on galaxies, such as the second-order perturbation theory (2LPT).“We can run these simulations in a few milliseconds, while other ‘fast’ simulations take a couple of minutes. Not only that, but we’re much more accurate,” Ho stated.Computer simulations are utilized to model a wide range of astronomical scenarios, such as how galaxies would react if the amount of dark energy varies over time.Dark Matter poses a Heavy QuestionWhen we look out at the Universe, all the stars and galaxies we see does not come close to accounting for the effects of gravity. This finding was first discovered by Fritz Zwicky in the early 1930’s, and expanded by Vera Rubin four decades later.Today, we know that dark matter makes up roughly 27 percent of everything in the Universe, while all ordinary matter represents less than five percent of the total. The remainder — 68 percent — is dark energy, fueling the expansion of the Universe.The nature of dark matter, however, remains elusive.“Dark matter may not be made up of the matter we are familiar with at all. The matter that makes up dark matter could different. It may be filled with particles predicted by theory but that scientists have yet to observe,” NASA explains.As research continues, neural networks will become ever-more valuable to astronomers and astrophysicists seeking to uncover the nature of the Universe. This surprising new finding could assist researchers looking to advance both machine learning and artificial intelligence.I believe that at the end of the century the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted.” ― Alan Turing“We can be an interesting playground for a machine learner to use to see why this model extrapolates so well, why it extrapolates to elephants instead of just recognizing cats and dogs,” Ho remarked.Dark matter, along with dark energy, remains one of the greatest mysteries of the Universe. Artificial intelligence may prove essential in understanding this mystery — one of the most fundamental questions about the Universe that surrounds us all.Did you like this article?

5,10 Bad Habits of Unsuccessful People,"The first successful person I ever met — truly successful, with accomplishments I admired and ambition I strove to emulate — was an entrepreneur in his forties, a client of mine in the first real business I’d ever started. I was 24 and eager to learn; he was constantly cheerful, and had more money than he could count.We became close friends, and he told me eventually that he’d lost his wife, the love of his life, a half-decade before we met — the kind of loss, he said, that you never get over. It was a story that made his positive outlook seem all the more remarkable to me: Here was someone who had been through tragedy, and yet still made it a priority to do good things with his time and his money. He seemed to truly care about other people.Often, he’d tell me what he saw as the secret to his success: “I just try to avoid being unsuccessful,” he said. He studied what made someone (avoidably) unhappy, broke, or unmotivated — and then he avoided making the same mistakes.I knew in my bones that he was right. Too often, we adopt a plug-and-play attitude: “If I do x, I’ll be successful.” But if success was easy and predictable, we wouldn’t be seeking advice on how to achieve it. Instead of studying what’s worked for other people, I’ve followed my friend’s advice, paying close attention to the habits that hold people back from reaching their goals.Here are 10 of the most common self-imposed barriers. If you find yourself bumping up against one, use them as a signal to reevaluate, reflect, and reverse course.In his book Essentialism, time-management consultant Greg McKeown describes running into a former classmate who was between jobs and looking for career advice. Midway through the conversation, the man looked down at his phone and began typing.“Ten seconds went by,” McKeown recounts. “Then 20. I simply stood there as he continued to text away furiously.” After a couple minutes, he gave up and walked away.I think of this story whenever I feel pulled in many different directions, as a way of reminding myself to focus on the moment I’m in and the people I’m with. If that old classmate of McKeown’s had reminded himself the same thing, he might have made a connection or gotten a tip that led him to a job.“I’m training for a marathon.” “I’m starting a business.” You know what’s better than announcing something on social media? Doing it.In his 2010 TED talk, “Keep You Goals to Yourself,” entrepreneur Derek Sivers argued that broadcasting your plans can be counterproductive rather than motivating. People will often applaud you simply for stating your intention, he said, and somewhat counterintuitively, that applause can sap your will to actually follow through on the plans you’ve just outlined.“When you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it, psychologists have found that it’s called a ‘social reality,’” Sivers explained in his talk. “The mind is kind of tricked into feeling that it’s already done. And then because you’ve felt that satisfaction, you’re less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary.”There’s nothing wrong with sharing your joy. But try to hold your tongue until you’ve got good news, not just good intentions.The friends you surround yourself with can encourage you to be your best self, or they can bring out your worst tendencies. Do you have a goal to get healthier, for example? Hang out with people who will encourage you to make those changes in your life. Want to utterly fail in that goal? Spend time with ones who revel in their own bad habits. People feed off each other’s energy.As my friend showed me years ago when he told me about his grief, you can focus on the positive without pretending life is easy. You can have a realistic perspective without pointing out the bad in everything you see.We all know the person who complains about everything. “Ugh, it poured this morning, and my shoes got soaked.” Yes, that sucks. No, you can’t change the weather. You can put on a new pair of shoes.Having a bad day is okay — everyone gets irritable once in a while. But if you always hate everything, you’re having a bad life. It’s that simple.In college, I once asked a professor to extend a deadline for an essay. His reply: “I’m perfectly happy to extend your deadline by a week. The only thing I’m asking you is, will your essay be better if you hand it in a week from now?”We both knew the answer was “no.” I worked my ass off to finish it on time.Only delay things when you’ll do a better job with that extra time. Do it now, or do it better later.Being a good listener can steer you in the right direction, but in the long term, it also helps you maintain close, valuable relationships.Everyone can give a hug, but not everybody calls just to ask, “How are you?” Put in the time. Ask, listen, care, repeat.We all have moments where we’re tempted to cancel plans. Sometimes, the effort of leaving the house can feel Herculean, even for something “fun.”But new and novel experiences are what makes life beautiful. When you give in to laziness, you’re not fully participating in your own life — which also isn’t fair to your friends, family, partner, and the other people who want to share it with you.It used to be that if your dad was a farmer — and you were a man — you became a farmer. Women didn’t get to choose what they wanted to be. And the ability to learn things beyond your immediate world was limited, if not impossible.Today, access to information is easier than it’s ever been. Obviously, there are still structural barriers that limit what people can do, but those who take advantage of this access to information — who read books, who ask questions, who follow their curiosity — have more power to envision, and shape, their futures. It’s hard to dream about what you don’t know.Just be a nice person. If you have difficulty defining what a “nice person” is, you’re likely a jerk.“The most certain way to succeed,” Thomas Edison once said, “is always to try just one more time.” Success, however you define it, never came from not trying. And often, it comes after first failing time and time again.Written by"
6,Amazon Accidentally Sent Out Their Email Template,"It’s comforting to see that even the titans of industry occasionally blunder.Last week, a Reddit user posted an email template that had been mistakenly sent out by Amazon. Although the full story behind the error is not known, it appears that a member of Amazon’s marketing team accidentally sent out the template before completing it.The Reddit post immediately took off, receiving 76,500 upvotes. If you have not yet seen the template, it looks like this:Although it is easy to chuckle at Amazon’s gaffe, it is important to recognize the intrinsic value of the leaked template. In fact, every marketing team could benefit from following the template’s simple instructions.Let’s break it down.A reader’s focus will initially gravitate to the photo at the top of the email. The image should be noticeable and attention-grabbing with bright and attractive colors. But, as you’ll notice in the template above, the image should not overwhelm the reader.A 600 x 200 image is the perfect size for attracting without overwhelming. Placing the image at the top of the email allows the reader’s focus to dwell there before moving to the headline.The headline cannot be too long, but it must summarize the entire purpose of the email. This is the most valuable space in the entire email. The quality of the headline will determine whether the reader continues to read the rest of the content or stops reading entirely.A good headline is hard to create. As the template states, the headline must summarize why this email is important. Why should your reader keep reading? What is in it for them? What do they stand to gain?These are all questions that must be answered when creating a successful headline.It’s important to note that the contents of the email template are not Amazon’s own creation. The words come from the writer Gary Provost, the author of the book “Make Every Word Count.” Provost understood that combining short and long sentences created a melody of words that would attract readers.Here are the same three paragraphs as above, this time highlighted in colors. The colors represent the length of the sentences — red being five words, yellow being two words or less, pink representing four words or less, green representing medium-length sentences, and blue representing long sentences. Look at how the colors of each paragraph change the rhythm and flow of the words:The marketing call to action, or CTA , should provoke an immediate response from your audience. Your audience should feel that they must click on whatever you are selling them or telling them. They must be intrigued, and they must be convinced that they will miss out on something worthwhile if they fail to follow the CTA.It sounds simple, but it’s shocking how many companies forget this advice. Time and time again, I see emails or marketing campaigns that just say “click here,” but that will never work.I have never clicked on a button at the bottom of a marketing email that says “click here,” and I imagine you have not either. The CTA needs to invoke an urge to act. The reader should see the words and feel that they must click on the link or be left out entirely.On their online blog, the marketing powerhouse HubSpot collected a list of powerful CTAs used by companies. Some examples: the agency EPIC uses “Let’s start a new project together,” and Humboldt County’s site invites readers to “Follow the Magic.” Others, like Netflix, follow a simple route by telling viewers to “Join free for a month.”The point here is simple: Think outside the box. What do your readers want to see? What are they interested in? If your CTA is not compelling, perhaps it’s time to brainstorm something new.Written by"
7,When Women ‘Dangle the Steak' in Front of Men,"I truly thought that by now, there wasn’t an online comment that could really hit me so hard it hurt.But oh man, I really did underestimate the ability of vile human beings using their words in the cruelest ways possible.A fellow writer explained, in a recent emotional article, how she was raped at a party, when she drifted off to sleep, by a guy she thought was decent.I replied with a comment, sending my heart out to her, because our stories were so incredibly similar. I was sexually assaulted by my boyfriend at the time, whom I was in love with.Enter the garbage human being. I’ll let his words explain the essence of who he is:Do this:For months, take a steak and put it in front of a big dog’s face, but right when the dog tries to grab it from your hand, pull it away.Do that at least three times a week for 3 months.Tell me how long it takes for that dog to continue pursuing that steak after you’ve pulled it away.Y’all know I’ve got some sh*t to say, so let’s get right to it.They have done absolutely nothing to validate that they deserved or asked for the deep violation enacted against them.They are not in charge of taking any semblance of responsibility for the depraved and selfish behaviour of others.Insinuating anything otherwise is absolutely incomprehensible and disgusting.I’m also going to explain the simple concept of what a healthy, functional romantic relationship looks like, coming from a woman who has both existed in an abusive relationship in the past and currently thrives in a fantastic and supportive marriage:When a partner truly respects you as a human being, they also respect your consent. They additionally appreciate that there is more to you than just a body, and said body does not exclusively exist for their sexual satisfaction.Based on your theory, I should have been sexually assaulted at least 3 times, by each of my partners.And yet, 2/3 of them did not try to rape me.In fact, I communicated the boundaries of my sexual activity, and the 2/3 in question replied:“Yeah, sure, of course. Whatever you’re comfortable with, I’ll respect that.”The man who sexually assaulted me was my boyfriend for over a year.My husband and I were together for almost 4 years before we got married and had intercourse for the first time.How does your little scenario explain that?I can’t believe I’m even taking the time to explain this sh*t right now, but f*ck, here we are.Men are not biologically-driven sexual animals — they are intentional human beings who make conscious decisions, just as every other person in the world.Women are not pieces of meat for the consumption of others.The consent of a human being is not synonymous to a tender, juicy steak.Dogs are simple creatures lacking in self-control (I have a rescue, I know this to be true). Your excuse of men being synonymous to an animal who cannot be held accountable for their actions is deplorable.Men are entirely in control of their actions and decisions. Whether or not they choose to exercise that self-control in ways that are morally right is a conscious decision — a decision which, when morality is ignored, rightfully comes along with consequences.Women who choose to exercise their basic human right to indicate their consent are not in charge of managing and accommodating for the sexual urges of grown a** adult men.F*ck right off.I even resent calling you “sir”.Frankly, I’d rather call you a “steaming pile of garbage”.Oh look, I just did it. Whoops.Just a question:Have you ever explained this little scenario comparison to the women in your life?What does your mom have to say about it? And your sister? Your female friends? How did they receive it?I imagine you haven’t mentioned it to them — because your comment is so entirely shameful that you truly could not confidently say this same sh*t to the women you love in your life.So what makes it in any way appropriate to say something so disgraceful to women online?Consider the women in your life for a moment… consider that 1/3 of those women who you truly love have been sexually assaulted.And your words directly shame these survivors.Give that a little thought for a quick second.There are plenty of things that I would like to type out to you, that I cannot publically put into words.But in a Twitter DM, with two other survivors, I can assure you that the depths of your depravity were discussed in detail, and we’ve got opinions about garbage people like yourself.You’ll never read this, because I blocked your sorry a** so fast after receiving this infuriating comment that I got whiplash.This is why safe communities for survivors and women are so damn important.Because people like you exist in the world — and we have a right to thrive in this space and tell our stories without your sickening abuse.Here’s hoping we never cross paths, ever again.Never miss a single beat — sign up for my monthly newsletter to get the scoop!👉 https://bit.ly/33XgtKTWritten by"
8,Why Do Men’s Legacies Matter More Than Women’s Safety?,"Almost immediately after Washington Post reporter Felicia Sonmez tweeted out a link to an article about the 2003 rape accusation against Kobe Bryant, who died on Sunday alongside his 13-year-old daughter and seven others, the harassment began. Sonmez was harangued and threatened, her address posted publicly. In fear for her safety, she checked into a hotel.On Monday, the Washington Post put Sonmez on administrative leave, noting in a statement that the paper was reviewing whether her tweets violated their social media policy, and saying that she “displayed poor judgment that undermined the work of her colleagues.”Her tweet, which was presented without comment, linked to a Daily Beast article from 2016 headlined, “Kobe Bryant’s Disturbing Rape Case.” She also tweeted about the thousands of people who responded with abuse and threats, and noted that it “speaks volumes about the pressure people come under to stay silent in these cases.”We can argue about when it’s appropriate to speak negatively about someone who has died tragically, and whether a person should be remembered by their worst moment. What is inarguable, however, is that a woman was punished — both personally and professionally — simply for drawing attention to a well-known allegation that reflected poorly on a beloved male celebrity.It’s an outrageous reminder that institutions will protect powerful men’s reputations above all else — even a woman’s safety.Washington Post media critic Eric Wemple writes that management asked Sonmez to take her tweets down, but that she was delayed because of the barrage of threats. Once the tweets were deleted and Sonmez had checked into a hotel, she found out she was being placed on leave; managing editor Tracy Grant told her in an email that her “behavior on social media is making it harder for others to do their work as Washington Post journalists.”How a tweet pointing to an accurate news story would make life difficult for other reporters is unclear. What is obvious is that Sonmez was reprimanded for tweeting something important.The Daily Beast article Sonmez linked to wasn’t salacious; it was a straightforward recounting of what happened in 2003: Bryant was accused of raping and choking a 19-year-old woman in Colorado. He was arrested and charged with felony assault, and the woman later requested the case be dropped because of the harassment and character assassination she faced. (In addition to threats from Bryant’s fans, the athlete’s defense team made a number of smears against the accuser, including that the vaginal trauma she suffered could have been from having multiple sexual partners over the course of several days.)What is not often talked about, but is extremely important, is that Bryant issued an apology where he made clear he believed the woman when she said she did not feel their encounter was consensual: “Although I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual, I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did. After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.”A woman was punished — both personally and professionally — simply for drawing attention to a well-known allegation that reflected poorly on a beloved male celebrity.Bryant also noted that the woman was not paid any money and that he did not doubt her motives for bringing the accusation forward.The truth is that it was a remarkable apology, one that recognized at least some of the harm caused. In fact, in a 2016 interview, Neil Irvin, the director of the nonprofit Men Can Stop Rape, said Bryant’s apology stood in stark contrast to other high-profile men’s responses to allegations of harassment or assault.“Kobe is the only accused individual who I’ve ever seen provide an apology in writing in my 16 years of doing rape prevention work,” Irvin said. “I read it and it fits with what I know about rape: survivors don’t lie… The question I’m left with is how do you honor Kobe’s statement and what appears to be his subsequent growth, without ignoring there was a survivor who also has to overcome the violence that Kobe admits to.”If Bryant’s fans are looking for a way to reconcile their love and grief with the accusation, one way would be to consider this apology as a sign of someone who seemed to be taking stock of the hurt he caused.All of which is to say: This is complicated. How to navigate reporting on a well-known person’s death and legacy — honoring the good they did while being honest about the bad — is not easy. Especially when you’re talking about issues of gender, sexuality, race, class, and celebrity.Yet, instead of using this moment as an opportunity to take on the nuance of the issue, the Post bent to power over truth and placed Sonmez on leave. It seems the paper’s higher-ups decided, in the midst of a safety crisis for one of their reporters, that public relations were more important than Sonmez herself.That’s not just wrong — it’s also misguided. Why would rape victims trust the Washington Post with their stories if they think the paper is more concerned with appeasing an online mob than holding powerful men to account?So let’s not mince words about what happened: A powerful publication silenced a female reporter for tweeting about rape. No matter how you feel about Bryant, speaking ill of the dead, or reporters on Twitter — that doesn’t serve anyone’s legacy.Written by"
9,Is A.I. the Antichrist?,"It may seem that old religious principles would have little to say about new technology, but in the Islamic community, the intersection of technology and religion is a common topic of discussion. Biotech, environmental conservation, smartphone use, and artificial intelligence are all relevant concerns to practicing Muslims. For example, as religious scholar Abdal Hakim Murad recently asked in a lecture: How would a person genetically engineered to have gills navigate the rulings around fasting in the month of Ramadan, where even drinking water is not allowed in daylight hours?Recently, I was forwarded text messages on WhatsApp introducing an intriguing idea: What if A.I. was the Antichrist? I’m a Muslim, but I’m not a conspiracy theorist, so I questioned the logic. I went down the rabbit hole, watching videos explaining the connection. The idea is part of a wider conversation about the concern that technology might be gaining importance over religion among Muslims.In each generation, there are people who believe we’re living in the end of times — or pretty close to it. Companions of the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم), the founder of Islam, thought that the end of the world would happen in their lifetimes, 1,400 years ago. People in every generation after that, Muslim or not, also thought they’d be the last on earth.But in Islamic belief, the Antichrist — known to Muslims as Dajjaal — will appear before the world ends. The prophecy says he will bring tyranny and misguidance to the world, use trickery to proclaim himself a prophet, and ultimately be defeated by the Prophet Eesa — the Muslim name for Christ.It is believed that some of Dajjaal’s identifying characteristics were passed down from the Prophet Muhammad so we can recognize him when he comes. One translation of these descriptions reads: “He will be a young man” who is “blind or defective” in his right eye. This eye will be “neither prominent nor sunken, and will look like a floating grape.” He will also be “sterile, with no children born to him,” and will deceive people, using special abilities, to bring rain.As a society, are we walking a dangerous line toward worshipping A.I.?Various people in history were rumored to be Dajjaal, including Adolf Hitler and Michael Jackson (who, at the height of his fame, had what some thought was a Dajjaal-like influence over his fans and used related symbolism in his music videos). Now there is a branch of Muslims who believe that A.I. could be Dajjaal, or at least a part of him. In these discussions, A.I. refers to not only artificial intelligence but also all the technologies that use it.Islamic scholars in eschatology, the branch of theology relating to the end of the world, use examples of current technology to link A.I. to Dajjaal. One example is Sheikh Imran Hosein, who has used scripture to theorize that Dajjaal will have a human form but will lack a soul and a self. He could be a robot — human-looking but soulless. The “eye like a floating grape” could be a computer or camera lens. Cloud seeding by A.I. could be the means through which he brings rain.It’s important to consider these abstract ideas because it’s healthy to question our relationship to technology. The broader concern at the root of these conversations is that Dajjaal’s control over the human race might have already begun with our growing addiction to technology. First comes fascination, then worship. My iPhone obsession has led me to ponder whether I am fulfilling my religious duty to worship God and no one else. As a society, are we walking a dangerous line toward worshipping A.I.?In scholarly settings, as well as on local radio stations, in mosques, or in informal gatherings, Muslims often discuss how prophecies from 1,400 years ago apply today, and whether the words of the Prophet Muhammad are to be taken literally in certain contexts, as in the case of Dajjaal and technology. The sayings of the Prophet Muhammad are often broad enough to allow for this type of interpretation, so these ideas are not seen as particularly controversial, especially because most Muslims already accept the basic notion that Dajjaal will exist in some form.The most serious of these discussions live in scholarly circles, special lectures on the end of time, and conspiracy theory message boards. For most people, however, they occur in occasional conversations with friends and are perhaps not taken as earnestly as discussions relating to practical rulings on contemporary daily life, since there’s no telling when these prophesied events may occur.Islamic teachings may be unresolved on the topic of A.I. and Dajjaal, but in other aspects of the intersection of life and technology, they are quite clear. For example, even though Muslims believe that the world will someday end on God’s command, we still have no right to destroy the planet: Conservation and the imperative not to waste are encoded into Islamic practice.Other aspects require more thought and perhaps new religious rulings, like questions around biotech. Are genetically modified foods halal — permissible for Muslims to consume? What can we do with our bodies and organs, according to Islamic law, and what are the limits? Medical intervention is accepted and even encouraged in Islam, but trying to improve on human creation by genetic engineering is more complicated. Whether it’s permissible to use your smartphone as a Quran, however, remains up for debate.Nevertheless, though it often seems that there is a disconnect between science and religion, the two are surprisingly complementary.Most ethical debates around technology are framed in a humanist, atheist, or at least agnostic way. But it is useful to consider how beliefs around technology may be shaped by something deeper than consumerism and secular values. There are approximately 1 billion Muslims in the world, and apart from Muslims, billions more people of other faiths who also must consider these issues in relation to their beliefs. A significant portion of the world may hold widely different views on tech than the usual Silicon Valley crew. Exploring their ideas may bring to light new ways of looking at our relationship to technology and allow for a wider, more all-encompassing conversation — regardless of whether you believe we should be watching technology for signs of Dajjaal.Written by"
10,Does Your College Use Facial Recognition Tech? Find Out Here.,"College applicants and students can now check whether nearly 90 universities in the United States may use facial recognition on their campuses.Technology activism organization Fight For The Future, as well as Students for Sensible Drug Policy, surveyed colleges asking if they would ever consider installing the technology. Representatives from 45 schools, including Carnegie Mellon University, Barnard College and MIT, said their colleges were not using the technology and wouldn’t in the future. The other schools did not respond or comment.Privacy advocates have warned that facial recognition in public places removes the element of anonymity, meaning people can be actively tracked wherever they go.“[W]ould you support a new law that said whenever you go into public … you need to wear a digital barcode around your neck?” said Ben Ewen-Campen, a councilor for Somerville, Massachusetts who proposed the city’s now-enacted facial recognition ban.You can check which schools fall into each category at banfacialrecognition.com.Written by"
11,Microsoft Introduces Project Petridish to Find the Best Neural Network for your Problem,"Neural architecture search(NAS) is one of the hottest trends in modern deep learning technologies. Conceptually, NAS methods focus on finding a suitable neural network architecture for a given problem and dataset. Think about it as making machine learning architecture a machine learning problem by itself. In recent years, there have been an explosion in the number of NAS techniques that are making inroads into mainstream deep learning frameworks and platforms. However, the first generation of NAS models have encountered plenty of challenges adapting neural networks that were tested on one domain to another domain. As a result, the search for new NAS techniques is likely to continue driving new innovations in the space. Recently, Microsoft Research unveiled Petridish, a NAS algorithm to optimize the selection of neural network architectures.NAS exists because the process of designing neural networks is incredibly resource consuming. In the current deep learning ecosystem, relying on well-known, top-performing networks provides few guarantees in a space where your dataset can look very different from anything those proven networks have encountered before. In many cases, NAS methods often takes hundreds of GPU-days to find good architectures, and can be barely better than random search. There is another problem in machine learning that resembles the challenges of NAS techniques: feature selection.Just like NAS methods, feature selection algorithms need to extract relevant features for a model given a specific dataset. Obviously, selecting a feature is drastically simpler than a neural network architecture but many of the principle of feature selection techniques served as inspiration to the Petridish team.Given the recent popularity of NAS methods, many might think that NAS is a recent discipline. It is unquestionable that NAS has experienced a renaissance since 2016 with the publication of Google’s famous paper on NAS with reinforcement learning. However, many of its origin trace back to the late 1980s. One of the earlies NAS papers was the 1988 “Self Organizing Neural Networks for the Identification Problem”. From there, the space saw a handful of publication outlining interesting techniques but it wasn’t until the Google push that NAS got the attention of the mainstream machine learning community. If you are interested in the publication history of NAS methods, the AutoML Freiburg-Hannover website provides one of the most complete compilations up to this day.When exploring the NAS space, there are two fundamental types of techniques: backward-search and forward-search. Backward-search methods have been the most common approach for implementing NAS methods. Conceptually, backward-search NAS methods, starts with a super-graph that is the union of all possible architectures, and learns to down-weight the unnecessary edges gradually via gradient descent or reinforcement learning. While such approaches drastically cut down the search time of NAS they have a major limitation in the case that they require human domain knowledge is needed to create a supergraph in the first place.Forward-search NAS methods try to grow neural network architectures from small to large. This approach resembles many of the principles of feature selection algorithms in deep learning models. Unlike backward approaches, forward methods do not need to specify a finite search space up front making them more general and easier to use when warm-starting from prior available models and for lifelong learning.Petridish is a forward-search NAS method inspired by feature selection and gradient boosting techniques. The algorithm works by creating a gallery of models to choose from as its search output and then incorporating stop-forward and stop-gradient layers to more efficiently identify beneficial candidates for building that gallery, and uses asynchronous training.The Petridish algorithm can be broken down in three fundamental phases:The incorporation of the Pareto frontier is an interesting addition to Petridish that allow researchers to more easily determine the architecture that achieves the best combination of properties they’re considering for a particular task. The estimate of the Pareto frontier makes it easier to see the tradeoff between accuracy, FLOPS, memory, latency, and other criteria. In the following figure, the models along the Pareto frontier (red line) make up the search output, a gallery of models from which researchers and engineers can choose.Microsoft Research evaluated Petridish across different NAS benchmarks. Specifically, Petridish was tested on image classification models using the CIFAR-10 dataset and then transferring the results to ImageNet. On CIFAR-10, Petridish achieves 2.75 ±0.21 percent average test error, with 2.51 percent as the best result, using only 3.2M parameters and five GPU days of search time on the popular cell search space. On transferring the models found on CIFAR-10 to ImageNet, Petridish achieves 28.7 ±0.15 percent top-1 test error, with 28.5 percent as the best result, using only 4.3M parameters on the macro search space. The initial tests were able to outperform state of the art NAS methods while maintaining viable levels of computing cost.Petridish is an interesting addition to the fast growing ecosystem of NAS techniques. The fact that Petridis relies on forward-searching models makes it even more intriguing as most popular NAS methods relied on backward-search techniques. Microsoft already includes NAS models as part of its Azure ML platform so it would be interesting is Petridish becomes part of that stack.Written by"
12,Isaias Hernandez Is Making Space for Queer People of Color in the Environmental Movement,"Climate change is harmful to all humans, but intersections of class, race, and gender alike can make certain groups more vulnerable. From the ways that redlining puts communities of color at higher risk during heatwaves to the negative global impact on indigenous populations, it’s clear that institutional privilege extends protections even when it comes to the environment. But in the fight for environmental justice, these voices often suffer for lack of mainstream representation.Isaias Hernandez runs Queer Brown Vegan, an Instagram page that provides educational breakdowns of environmental terms with an emphasis on intersectional perspectives. A graduate of UC Berkeley’s environmental science program, Hernandez has studied climate change and worked within student organizations to diversify the field. Hernandez spoke with Tenderly about his experiences as a POC in environmental spaces, how he came to co-found Alluvia Mag, and how he veganizes his childhood favorite Mexican dishes.Isaias Hernandez: I’m Mexican American, and my parents are originally from Mexico. I’m originally from Los Angeles, CA. Mainly the San Fernando Valley, if you’re familiar with the area.A lot of the dishes that my parents would make when I was growing up were Mexican dishes. A lot of the times, the standard set of foods in a Mexican household is rice, beans, and tortillas. For me, I remember Saturday breakfasts were always chorizo and potatoes. And that’s obviously something that’s changed now, we do soyrizo and potatoes, or use JUST Egg. One of the most memorable dishes for me is called pambazo — it’s essentially torta bread that’s dipped in salsa. The filling can have meat, but my mom would always put mashed potatoes in it. And then you can sprinkle it with onion, lettuce, cheese, or cream. And it’s easy to do a vegan version of that.My older sister was vegan back in high school, and I was in middle school at that time. She would always talk about animal cruelty — she was very woke in the sense that she would tell me all about these injustices that happened in the system. I was open to hearing it out, and I accepted it. And then in college, I started developing illnesses. Near the end of my senior year of college, I wasn’t able to digest a lot of animal based products. At that point I’d already cut out red meat, and was only eating chicken. And eventually I got pretty sick, and my doctor told me to write a food diary. Essentially, I figured out that I was very allergic to animal based products. My doctor advised me to cut them out of my diet.When I was at school, I was also involved in various organizations. Some of them talked about animal cruelty, but another aspect that really resonated me was advocating for farm workers’ rights. I felt that going vegan, for me, was a step towards not only bettering my physical and mental health, but for contributing toward the greater good and society as a whole.Yeah, there’s an event called the Vegan Street Fair held in the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles, it’s been around for a few years now. It’s essentially a community of vegans, mainly made up of people of color. And I sought out this community, and talked to a lot of people, and it gave me a more comfortable zone to be in and understand that there are other vegans out there who look like me. People of color, especially Mexican people. And they were able to really introduce me to a lot of concepts and ideas that really reconnected me to my own ancestral roots — that plant-based dishes have been part of our lifestyle, and that the Mexican foods I eat can be made vegan. And it’s much healthier, and still so delicious. There are so many plant-based meat alternatives that you can use in Mexican dishes. It was a big change, but it wasn’t as hard as I thought it would be, once I was educated properly.One of the main reasons that I originally wanted to pursue environmentalism is that I felt that one, whenever I would go to nature events growing up, nobody there really looked like me. Even in college, that was still the case — and additionally, I also noticed there weren’t many people who shared a queer identity. So I felt that I have these two different backgrounds. One, being a person of color in the environmental field, where it’s largely dominated by white people. And two, how I can navigate my queerness in these settings, when a lot of the first people impacted by environmental injustices are low-income, queer trans people of color. And I’ve known that these communities have been organizing since the beginning to demand justice, and they’re not really given the recognition or platform to talk about their experiences. Mainstream environmentalism views it as not as important or popular to address. And of course there’s great work being done for the environment, but also this work often fails to recognize how race, environment, class, status, and gender intersect. So I want to use my platform to communicate with a wide audience, and especially as a way to connect with other queer people of color. Because I didn’t really have anyone to look up to as I was entering these spaces, and it can be hard to navigate.I co-created the magazine with one of my best friends. What really inspired us — well, we actually Googled “environmental people of color magazines” and nothing really showed up. So we thought, wouldn’t it be really great to highlight black, indigineous people of color doing dope work related to the environment, through an artistic or creative lens? So during the year when I lived in Oakland postgrad, and while she was still a senior in college, we worked to connect with people in the Bay Area, and out of state too. And essentially what bloomed out of that was a project highlighting narratives of climate storytelling that came from perspectives of environmentalists who are people of color. Alluvia is a platform for people seeking diversity in the environmental movement.Currently, we’re doing outreach to any writers that may be interested in an op-ed piece for our second issue, and any environmental creatives to contribute to the issue as well. We’re trying to reach outside of California, and really highlight different areas and different communities. Especially because California is generally a pretty environmentally friendly state, we want to really make sure that voices from other places are getting out there too.There’s this page called Slow Factory, and it’s an environmental education page that really highlights a lot of topics within sustainability and environmentalism. They really dig deep and deconstruct what words really mean, and provide a clear context of race and class to those terms. So they’re great at providing a deeper understanding of what sustainability really is.Another page that I love is run by one of my good friends actually — it’s called Go Green Save Green. She’s a woman of color, and she highlights a lot of environmental topics and news articles. The page really helps people stay informed about what’s happening currently in the environmental sphere.And lastly, another friend of mine runs a page called Brown Girl Green. She’s half Jewish and half Filipina, a brown environmentalist. She talks about what it’s like to be a woman of color in the environmental field, and covers a variety of topics.You really want to ask yourself, what are the things that I can instantly eliminate from my diet? I didn’t cut out all animal products at once, I stopped consuming things one by one. My first step was to stop eating red meat, and fish, since I hardly ate that to begin with. I’d say you should start including vegan substitutes while you’re still eating meat, or while you’re vegetarian. I think a lot of the time, we don’t really give ourselves the opportunity to try all the options that are out there. And now, in 2020, veganism has really exploded, and there are so many incredible options out there.And it’s not all about being perfect — I know that mistakes are to be made. The most important part is that you’re thinking about the impact of what you’re doing, and what it means to you on a personal level, but also in terms of your environmental impact.A quick thing I love to make — because you know, as millennials, we’re always on the go — is spaghetti. Trader Joe’s has these amazing vegan meatballs, they’re so good. It’s really affordable to get pasta, marinara sauce, zucchini, and mushrooms. It’s really quick to make — and it only costs around $8 for several portions.A complaint that I think we all hear a lot is that veganism is expensive, but it really doesn’t have to be. And yes, buying processed products is expensive, but if you incorporate produce and shop resourcefully, it doesn’t have to cost any more!Written by"
13,Stop Calling Animals ‘It’,"At its core, veganism is simply a philosophy that rejects the exploitation of animals. However, the vegan movement is full of different ideas, expanding and broadening as time passes. Intersectionality, a term coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw in 1989, is, in her words, “…a lens through which you can see where power comes and collides, where it interlocks and intersects. It’s not simply that there’s a race problem here, a gender problem here, and a class or LBGTQ problem there. Many times that framework erases what happens to people who are subject to all of these things.” Intersectionality is what inspires some animal rights activists to fight for the rights of oppressed slaughterhouse workers or for expanding access to fresh produce for those living in food deserts, and allows us to make links between structural racism and misogyny and the violence perpetrated against animals.Language is one of the next big frontiers for the vegan philosophy, and we as activists have an opportunity to influence others to change something that may seem innocuous to the average person: Referring to other animals as if they’re objects.There’s no arguing that the way we choose to express ourselves can impact our own perception and those of our audience: so why not use language to bring us closer to animals?Recently, a stranger asked me about my dog, Daryl, whom I adopted from a local shelter. “What kind of dog is it? It looks like a German Shepherd.” The question took me aback. “HE is probably a German Shepherd mix, but I’m not sure,” I abruptly replied. This stranger didn’t mean any harm, and her words certainly didn’t bother Daryl. But it reignited my passion for a philosophy that I adopted a long time ago: not calling other animals “it.”By now, we all know that the way we use language can shape our ideas and culture. Parenting experts release novel-length guides to using language to bring up children, how certain words and phrases impact their perception of the world and reward systems. Linguists and psychologists have developed programs for trauma survivors that center almost exclusively on using language to move past their experiences and live normal lives. And perhaps most insidiously, big marketing companies spend time and money researching exactly which words and phrases impact our buying decisions. There’s no arguing that the way we choose to express ourselves can impact our own perception and those of our audience: so why not use language to bring us closer to animals?When my son Sam was two, like many kids, he was afraid of insects. Seeing one, he’d either scream and run away or hide behind my leg until I reminded him he was safe. Being vegan though, we didn’t kill the spiders who lived in each bathroom and the ceiling corners of our kitchen. Sometimes this made Sam a little terrified of potty training. I didn’t want to relocate our peaceful roommates, so I devised a plan to name all our spiders, with the hope that it would endear my son to our scary house-guests.One by one, we named every spider and wrote it in large lettering on a note card, which we placed next to each reachable one until we got to the biggest, scariest Wolf spider who lived in our downstairs bathroom, the most-used bathroom in the house. He was big for a house spider and lived right behind the toilet, which, to a frightened two-year-old was prime toe-biting territory. We decided on a name and since this was the bathroom most frequented by guests, his card read “This is Daniel. He lives here and we love him, please don’t touch, smoosh or move him. Thank you.” We would greet him daily, have lengthy one-way conversations, tell jokes, and each time we’d potty train in Daniel’s bathroom, I would sing “Daniel my Spider” to the tune of Elton John’s “Daniel.” Later, I’d discover he was most likely female, and since Wolf spiders only live about a year or so, Daniel was no one’s brother and was not older than me.The simple act of giving a name and story to another animal taught my son to respect and love someone who didn’t look like him or share the same behaviors.I can’t recall how long it took, or when we phased out the note cards and songs, but since my experiment, Sam, who is now 9, has no fear of bugs — except, of course, for the occasional “surprise bathroom roach,” but I’d argue that anyone would be a little disturbed to find an unexpected person in the bathroom. The simple act of giving a name and story to another animal taught my son to respect and love someone who didn’t look like him or share the same behaviors.According to Writer’s Digest, we should only be referring to other animals as “he” or “she” when we have a personal attachment to them, like Daniel and Daryl. It’s also acceptable when reading a book where animals who can speak are the main characters. In all other cases, one is expected to use “it.” I believe this standard is outdated and offensive.I believe the closest we can come to defining the vegan perspective is that we extend personhood to other animals, which leaves no room for referring to them in the same way that we do objects.In veganism, the reason we abstain from objectifying animals and consuming their byproducts is because we recognize behaviors and traits that resemble or completely mirror our own: family, connection, and the wish to be free and alive. Though the definition of the word “person” refers only to humans, I believe the closest we can come to defining the vegan perspective is that we extend personhood to other animals, which leaves no room for referring to them in the same way that we do objects.If not “it,” then what? For over 600 years, those using the English language have used the word “they” to refer to unspecified individuals and those who don’t identify exclusively as masculine or feminine. It’s been an essential tool for genderqueer, trans, and non-binary individuals to reclaim their identities, and as a society, embracing “they” helps us tear down gendered expectations of each other. And while it’s far more important to focus our new language expectations on how we refer to fellow human beings, whose emotional and mental well-being rely on those they know and love reifying their identity, I would argue that… while we’re at it, why not include other animals on our journey to include the rejection of objectification as well?Changing our language can be difficult, but that doesn’t make it any less essential to veganism. Some of my biggest heroes in the vegan movement still use “it” to refer to other animals. I think this is partly because it’s hard: we begin learning communication and language from the moment we’re born and eliminating words and phrases can seem daunting. Also, because other animals don’t have a known opinion on the subject, they aren’t advocating one way or the other. But just as how choosing references for other humans has a positive cultural impact on oppressed individuals, so can choosing the way we reference other animals.For someone like me, who has dedicated years to the practice of eliminating the “it” word from how I refer to other animals, hearing it is like nails on a chalkboard. This is the same feeling as when I see someone chewing the meat off a bone or tossing chickens into a crate. At its core, referring to a cow, chicken or pig as “it” is an act of speciesism, which is exactly what we seek to eradicate as vegans. If we want to change the world for animals and create more compassionate consumers, we must take responsibility for the way we look at and refer to other animals.Perhaps this language change could open doors for non-vegans to begin associating other animals in the same way that vegans do, as individuals with feeling and interests, not as objects. Much like veganism, the practice of choosing better words for other animals will get easier as time goes on. When referring to the next animal you meet, use “they” until you’re told otherwise by their human companion. Believe me, no one will be asking you to refer to Fluffy as “it.”Written by"
14,You’re Running All Wrong,"Optimize Your Run, Defy Death and Attain Superpowers“You’re doing it all wrong.”A tall, willowy man with an aquiline nose, fair skin and long dark waves of flowing hair sat across from me. He was a voice teacher. A revered expert, in fact.According to him.“I’ll have another,” he said, raising his nearly empty bottle of Stella and nodding to me.“…and I’ll tell you how to make it right. So you don’t ruin your voice.”This was important to me — being a singer.I was also a bartender, by the way. A common and respectable combination. And it was slow that night. I looked forward to times like these though the money was not great. (Fewer customers = fewer tips) The conversation with patrons was often more meaningful, introspective, even philosophical.“There’s a reason you have a nose,” the Aquilined One began.“When you breathe, it filters and warms the air before it’s drawn into the lungs. If you breathe through your mouth, you’ll rip up your throat. You need to breathe only through your nose.”I know what you’re thinking. Maybe you’re not a singer. Maybe you’re not even a talker. Maybe you don’t care what happens to your voice.How would you like to increase your lung capacity? Or feel relaxed during your run instead of stressed out. Or look forward to your runs as your time to be inspired.I took Aquiline Guy’s stern advice and commenced breathing only through my nose when running. It was not easy.For the first two weeks, I was out of breath, tired and even a bit head-achy, sucking in the cold Chicago air forcefully through my nose, into my head. I had to slow down a lot, which was not encouraging. But I stuck with it.Slowly something beautiful happened. I adjusted.Besides feeling more badass in general for having the discipline to do this, there were unforeseen benefits.I found the fabled Runner’s High. I was an endorphin junkie. The feeling was euphoric.One night, singing a jazz standard with my band, just for fun, I tried to hold a note 4 measures longer than usual. The crazy thing was: I was able to hold it twice as long as that, almost effortlessly. It was shocking. My lung capacity had dramatically expanded.I started to feel so relaxed during my runs that I almost felt I could — if I wanted — seamlessly and instantly fall asleep. It was weird.I started to look forward to my runs as my time to be inspired, unravel problems, come up with new ideas. I found myself using my runs to write most of the lyrics for new songs.Recently, I learned through an article on yogic practices, the probable reason for this extreme feeling of relaxation and why running had become my favorite time for problem-solving and lyric-writing. According to Dr. John Douillard DC, CAP, nasal breathing during exercise increases alpha brain wave activity.The “alpha state” is that not-quite-asleep zone we find ourselves in just before dosing off. It’s the mental state sustained in meditation as well as the state of being in “the flow” artists and athletes rhapsodize over.Years later, I learned nasal breathing stimulates the sinuses to release nitric oxide which has lots of amazing benefits that don’t happen during mouth-breathing.Nitric oxide:Nose breathing was just part of my education in running, though.Since I loved running so much, I overdid it. I ran 5 miles every day without fail. On concrete.This caused a terrible condition known as shin-splints. It’s an inflammation of the muscle tissue attached to the shinbone.Ever been kicked in the shins? It’s like that except the pain goes on. I used to just blow it off and “power through,” running the next day and the next until it was unbearable.I wrapped my shins tightly with ace bandages to help ease the pain. And I kept running. I didn’t see how crazy this was until my chiropractor asked about my strange habit.Chiropractor: Why are you wrapping your legs like that?Me: Oh, no big deal. It’s just shin splints from running.Chiropractor: You have to stop that.Me: Running? I can’t.Chiropractor: Yes you can. Your’re impacting your legs with such force that it’s pulling the muscle away from the bone.Me: Ew…Chiropractor: Yeah, so don’t wrap your legs anymore and stop running ’til your legs heal.Me, with desperation: Then what?Chiropractor: Then don’t run every single day. And run on a softer surface. And on your toes.Well. That was a lot of new information to take in. I was ON it.Like most city runners I had been running on the sidewalk much to the chagrin of people walking their dogs and anyone with a child in a stroller. This would have to stop.I didn’t have access to a track at the time so I chose the asphalt of the streets as this actually is a much softer surface.It was also dangerous. I wasn’t sharing the space with erratic chasing dogs on strained leashes, hilariously bouncing babies in strollers and their annoyed swerving parents. I was sharing it with busses, motorcycles, scooters and yes, cars.So I strategized to keep myself safe. I could run defensively if I ran the opposite way traffic was going. This seemed to freak out a few drivers, but at least I could see in the distance — with some notice — when a 2-tonne machine with wheels was careening my way. Maybe some fancy footwork, but no surprises.And about that footwork, running on my toes…this was not the easiest thing to get used to. I felt almost embarrassed by it. Would people stare at me and laugh?“Mommy, why is that funny lady ballet dancing in the street?”Let them talk.I got used to it and found it decreased the impact on my shins as well as my knees, which had also started to ache.I tapered down my running routine to 4 days a week, then 3. After overdoing it one day, my knees were so sore and swollen that I had to take 6 months off running. Since my dad had his knees replaced and it did not seem like much fun, I took this injury seriously.Today I run a few miles a few days a week. Sometimes I run at the gym on an actual running track and sometimes in the streets with all the fun excitement that comes with that experience.I do find running uphill exhilarating. One more thing to remember though: hills are meant for running UP, never DOWN. Running down a hill increases the impact on one’s muscles and joints to a much higher degree and increases the chances that you’ll trip and fall.The main thing to remember about running — for me, the closest feeling on earth to flying — is love & respect of the greatest piece of equipment I will ever have; my own magnificent body.Written by"
15,"If You Want to Live the Life of Your Dreams, You Must Be Fearless","Everyone has dreams, fewer people have intentions, less have plans, and then there’s the very last few who actually leap.What happens between the inception of an idea and its execution is that people become dismayed by what they will lose, which is a lot. Security, status, the general sense that people know what you’re doing with your life and so through their eyes, you can maybe feel alright about yourself.I am sorry to have to be the one to tell you that if you want the life of your dreams, you’re going to have to do what everyone else is afraid to do.You are going to need to be fearless in the face of everything that could go wrong. You are going to need to be unafraid to rack up debt, to hire a staff, to admit what you don’t know, to let someone else support you, to take home almost no income for the first months or years of your venture, to break out of the standard work structure and flow, to invest heavily in yourself and your skill set sometimes to the tune of your life savings and almost always at the cost of your comfort zone.You must applaud the people who are doing what you want to be doing and instead of trying to belittle them, you have to learn from them.You are going to need to be fearless in the face of being disliked, because people will dislike you, and it will probably get worse the better your life gets. People are jealous, small, and vindictive and you know this because you have the capacity to be all of those things, too. But it doesn’t matter, because now you have to rise. Now you have to applaud the people who are doing what you want to be doing and instead of trying to belittle them, you have to learn from them.You are going to have to not just hope that rejection doesn’t happen too often, but plan for it. You are going to have to be okay with being mocked, with being misunderstood, with being disliked. You are going to have to be okay with looking bad. You are going to have to be okay with failing, often publicly.This is part of the process.This is the part most people won’t do, which is why nothing ever changes for them.You are going to have to be fearless in the face of insecurity — that big, bad, lifelong bully that chains most people to their past lives. You are going to have to totally annihilate your concept of “living well,” and reaching “comfort,” and being safe and making smart choices.You are going to have to be fearless in the face of letting go of the dreams you had for a person you no longer are. You are going to have to take a long, hard look at what you’ve built and ask yourself honestly if it still matches the person you intend to be. When we’re young, we design a life for the person we think we’ll become. When we arrive, we often hold too tightly to a blueprint made for someone else.The beginning of your new life, the part of your existence where things get really, really good, is often a letting go. A shedding, a release.If you’re courageous enough, this is the part where you’ll come alive.This is the part where you’ll realize that absolutely anything you risked was worth it because what you get in return for those infinitesimal seconds of discomfort is far greater than you could have dreamed.What you’ll trade for maybe being generally liked by a lot of people is being absolutely loved for having a life-changing, massive impact on the lives of a few (or, really, a lot more than you’d ever reach if you kept playing small).What you’ll trade for being brave enough to show up exactly as you are is so much more respect, admiration, and connection than you’d ever receive trying to be someone you aren’t.What you’ll trade for an idea of security is actual security, because your sense of safety is no longer within a role or job or position or idea, it’s within you.What you’ll trade for a lukewarm life is one that’s on fire, one in which you finally are doing what you came here to do.Will every day of your new life be ablaze with this kind of fiery passion? No. It will still be hard, you will still worry, you will still fear, it will still be boring sometimes. But anything you do has risk, anything you do will be scary sometimes, anything will be boring once in a while. The point isn’t that you’re able to escape all of that, the point is that you’re willing to endure it for a greater outcome.If you really want the life of your dreams, you’re going to have to be willing to do what other people won’t.You are going to have to be the version of you that you know you are deep down.You are going to have to be uncomfortable.You are going to have to be fucking fearless.You are going to find that there’s no other way to live.Written by"
16,Diving into Abstractive Text Summarization — Part 1,"Text summarization is nowadays one of the most studied research topics in natural language processing (NLP) and has its applications in almost all domains of the internet, for example, e-shops, search engines and news websites that use summaries to give readers an overview of what a particular article might talk about.Text Summarization is a task to generate a shorter and concise version of a text while preserving the meaning of the original text.[1]Text summarization algorithms can be classified into two main categories:Extractive text summarization algorithms are capable of extracting key sentences from a text without modifying any word [2][3]. Abstractive summarization, instead, involves a complex process understanding the language, the context and generating new sentences. This frees the model of the constraint of using pre-written text but involves using large-scale data during training.A lot of algorithms for both extractive and abstractive text summarization are based on Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN). Furthermore, using RNNs in an Encoder-Decoder manner leads us to the well known Sequence-To-Sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture [4], which is one of the most used and best-performing approaches in machine translation. Most of the current advancements have been performed on very short summaries and documents: a lot of algorithms tend to perform worse when a big document has to be summarized in more than a few words. The majority of state-of-the-art algorithms use pre-trained word embeddings, for a better understanding of the concepts expressed in a text.Nowadays the amount of textual data is massive, and this led researchers to develop algorithms capable of representing words mathematically, in order to solve complex problems. What are word embeddings? Wikipedia states that a word embeddingis the collective name for a set of language modeling and feature learning techniques in natural language processing (NLP) where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers. Conceptually it involves a mathematical embedding from a space with one dimension per word to a continuous vector space with a much lower dimension.Word embeddings are learned in order to make these vectors capture all the semantical, hierarchical and contextual pieces of information in a word. The process of choosing the best embeddings for a project is often a trial-and-error methodology. By the way, some of the most famous and effective techniques for learning word embeddings are Word2Vec [5] and GloVe [6].Let’s focus on GloVe: it is an unsupervised learning algorithm developed at Stanford University for generating word embeddings by factorizing a global word-word co-occurrence matrix from a corpus. Resulting embeddings show interesting linear substructures.Embeddings of words like Verizon and Vodafone are very close to each other, while man and woman are quite distant.For this project I’ve used Keras, an Open Source Deep Learning Library written in Python, running on top of Intel® Optimization for TensorFlow. In practice, you can download GloVe pre-trained vectors here and add them to your model in Keras using an Embedding Layer.Once we set up a dictionary which maps words to vectors, we can build the embedding weights matrix that’ll be set in the model.We can now create the Embedding layer in Keras using the following command:There are plenty of datasets for text summarization. The most famous (and large) is the GigaWord Dataset, which can be purchased here and consists of nearly 10 million documents and over 4 billion tokens. If you want to do some experiments on publicly available datasets first, there are also the BBC News Summary and the Amazon Fine Food Reviews datasets.We can easily build a vanilla Seq2Seq model for abstractive text summarization using Keras, in order to train the model and evaluate its performance. A bidirectional LSTM is used for the Encoder, while the Decoder is made of a single unidirectional LSTM. The model has been trained on a single node of an Intel® Xeon® platform.Making a machine measure how much a predicted summary is “good” may seem quite strange. Furthermore, applying the standard accuracy measure is not the right choice for summarization. In 2004 Lin published a paper about a new package with more than just one metric used for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation algorithms, called Rouge: Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation [7]. The most common metrics from ROUGE are:There are a few GitHub repositories with Python implementations of the ROUGE metrics that you can use in your own projects, like this and this.We’ve discovered what is text summarization, how words can be represented mathematically in a vector space, a Seq2Seq model used for abstractive summarization, some of the datasets available and a set of metrics used to evaluate summaries. In Part. II the training process either on a single node or on multiple nodes will be explained in detail and some results will be shown.This article is one of a series of posts done as part of an Intel AI Incubator project for which I am part of. The project makes use of Intel® Optimization for TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn. Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors were used to train the model.Written by"
17,You Aren’t Supposed to Love the Way You Look,"If you’re like most people, you probably dislike photos of yourself.It’s not because you look bad — it’s because the way a camera captures your image is not the same as how you see yourself in the mirror. It’s the difference between what you expect to see and what you actually see. The problem is unfamiliarity.The digital age has blown this out of proportion.Our fixation on appearance is unprecedented. Never before in human history have our lives and bodies been so exposed, documented, and shared. To make matters worse, a constant barrage of highly edited images infiltrate the internet, widening our expectation gap and leading us to invent hyper-idealized versions of who we imagine we’re supposed to be. Anything less is humiliating, a public failure.When you try to compose a “best self,” which is really just your most physically perfect self, you begin to forget something really important: You’re not supposed to love the way you look.Do you remember the first time you saw yourself in the mirror?If not, do you remember the first time you saw yourself in a photo, or in a home video? Most likely, your response was not to think your jawline looked sharp or your legs seemed proportionate. You probably expressed intrigue and interest, but overall emotional neutrality. That’s because, by nature, your body is a neutral entity.As you grew up, you eventually determined that attractive people gain clout. They are more desirable, and therefore seem to hold more power.First you couldn’t accept yourself, and now you can’t be totally in love with yourself.Maybe you never stop associating ideal physical characteristics and social status. You spend the entirety of your life feeling inadequate and inferior. You don’t stop to ask if you're viewing yourself accurately, or if you’re prioritizing your values. Instead, a negative spiral takes hold: Your body is not ideal, so you’re doomed to occupy the lower end of the social hierarchy for eternity. In response to overwhelming negativity, you — consciously or not — subscribe to the “love yourself” philosophy. It seems to have worked wonders for everyone else, so maybe it will for you.The problem, you imagine, is that you’re not in love with your physical form. But this line of thinking only perpetuates more unrealistic standards. First you couldn’t accept yourself, and now you can’t be totally in love with yourself.You don’t stop to recognize that you were not designed to think this way.Often, when you have issues with self-image, acceptability, or desirability, you project them onto your physicality: the one thing you think you can control. But “loving yourself,” despite what some people might want you to believe, is not a matter of looking in a mirror and feeling physically or sexually attracted to yourself. Real self-love is much deeper than that — it’s not a decision you can make or a switch you can flip. It goes to the core of who you are, and who you think you can be.When you address what really matters — your connections with others, the impact you have on the world around you, the quality of your friendships, how you care for yourself — your concern with surface-level issues fades. Sure, you may still want to look your best, but it’s not the all-consuming problem it used to be.Hate does not motivate us to love, it only holds us back from living.What you see in others depends on what you’re committed to seeing in yourself. If you dislike someone, everything they do irritates you and nothing seems like enough to redeem them. Your own self-image is the same way. When you hate yourself for deeper reasons, you spend your time fixated on surface-level things. Your obsession with parts of your body is code for deeper dissatisfactions with who you perceive yourself to be.Hate does not motivate us to love, it only holds us back from living. If and when you can commit to truly trying to find the best in yourself, and to loving the invisible parts of yourself from an authentic place, you become enough. And that’s because you’re actively working to see yourself that way. Not perfect, not ideal, but enough.Nobody is going to convince you to have self-esteem. Healthy self-esteem only develops when you realize that being your own enemy is not moving you even the slightest bit closer to having the life you want.You cannot hate yourself into the life you want. You cannot hate yourself into the body you want. You cannot hate yourself into the love you want.When you’re committed to taking care of yourself and playing the hand you were dealt, you generate true self-love because you’re building on a solid foundation. And then, everything changes.Written by"

LogRhythm is using top end security solutions for various firms to detect and respond to different cybersecurity threats. The company’s machine learning profile helps in detecting threats and other online anomalies.2. A brand like CrowdStrike uses cloud-based endpoint security software which is called Falcon that offers prevention against cyber and proactive threats in various industries such as retail, healthcare, and finance.With AI & ML technology, electricity providers can effectively optimize power generation efficiency and can help predict future energy loads at granular levels. For instance, the concept of a “digital wind farm” by GE Renewable Energy comprises AI software that monitors turbine movement and helps enhance energy generation levels by up to 20%.The Codegreen Energy mobile application is saving billions of dollars with its energy-efficient AI enabled technology. The mobile application compares the efficiency of energy levels of thousands of buildings in order to determine if they are in compliance with the laws showing their Energy Star score.Do you like listening to stories or reading books on the radio? Trust me, these stories do not always come as you want to- it could be due to a busy schedule or various other reasons. The Storyteller mobile app will ensure that you can listen to your favorite books or novels, read to you in a true storytelling format.Simply paste in the story’s PDF or Word file or link to the app, and the mobile app will read it not as a dictation but as a professional narrator. This mobile app will also pre-determine your style of storytelling based on the hierarchical analysis of the received story.Artificial intelligence effectively automates the recruitment process like screening, candidate sourcing, and job matching, so it is one of the good app ideas that you can think of. AI based technology focuses on various other recruitment tasks and reduces its efforts by searching the internet for the right aspirants.Today, smart employers are widely using AI-enabled recruitment mobile applications to find the right candidates who have not been considered for job roles in the past, not because they were well qualified, but because they appear in search results or did not appear.Example:Recruitment chatbot is the best AI enabled recruitment tool that uses natural language to understand the text entered by the users. One of the main features of a recruitment chatbot is to offer real-time communication to the candidates and to schedule an interview with the recruiter.There are AI based tools that help in marketing the best recruitment channels using targeted messaging, tech-enabled automation and analytics. In the year 2019, AI-enabled recruitment marketing tools will be the best technique in order to advertise your company among job candidates.The concept of AI or machine learning tools has changed the way we read, search, and write text. There are advanced AI or machine learning applications that understand, search and read for you, this will also help researchers to learn about the development of the latest technology, tools and information.Examples:1.Udemy is one of the best examples of a learning mobile app that provides a wide gamut of courses for personal development, web development, and many more. You can also learn to play the guitar, Udemy offers dozens of courses to help.2. Goodreads is also one of the best ways to learn almost anything about technology, fiction, self-help, etc. The app has more than 40 million registered members and growing. The app helps users find the right book at the right time.Interactive interface is the latest trend in this digital era that focuses on how people interact with the system. Big brands such as Facebook, Amazon, Google and Microsoft are strongly focused on the development of different conversational interfaces.Examples:1. The Starbucks iPhone mobile app is a good example of a conversation interface that earns you rewards, allows you to interact with chatbots and can search the stores. The virtual assistant they use is “My Starbucks Barista, an AI based technology that can also clarify menu items and prices.2. Another popular example is Bank of America’s chatbot called Erica which helps bank clients make financial decisions such as balancing checks, making payments, analyzing expenses and making suggestions. Users can easily download Erika to their mobile phones and chat via voice or text message.Now these days, market traders need to be updated at every step of the market. The use of AI or machine learning app in the modern stock market keeps the shares rising and falling on a daily basis. You can also get help building a portfolio, check the real-time market value of any stock, get help understanding stock charts, market trends and everything from your mobile phone.Examples:1. For live market updates, NetDania Forex is one of the best app that sends you quotes on global stock exchanges, currency pairs, and major commodities. This mobile app sends you live notifications when economic data is released.2.

19,Some Insulting Things A Lot of White People Do,"I compiled a list of some annoying, creepy, inconsiderate, insulting, and/or disrespectful things some White people do which stresses me and other Black people out. I understand many of these things on my list aren’t necessarily intentional, but the intent of the actions don’t matter. The perception does. Your intentions can injure.Practice doing no harm.Say Not All White People. I know. I know. We’re not blaming all White people when we say White people.. I’m not talking about all White people, just the White people who do the uncomfortable and embarrassing stuff on this list and those who continue to believe they aren’t racist. But since you must come here to defend White people, Please read this first before you continue Take a day or two to meditate on it, then come back to read this list.Hijacking movements. I’m not even going there. Yes, I am. The Civil Rights Movement protected Blacks, but was hijacked by White women who dragged in everything they cared about to ensure they protected it. Now, everything is centered on White women. Everything. Black Lives Matter was to address Black lives mattering. Ya’ll took that and created All Lives Matter because God forbid we try to bring attention to ourselves, diverting attention from White people. #MeToo was for Black girls being sexually abused. You took that from us and made it about White women. Can we have something, please?White people, please stop this and even if you don’t do it, it is your job to stop your collective group from doing this. Every song or cry doesn’t have to be White centered. You don’t need a movement. You should move over and give others the space to protest. Look, listen, act. Don’t co-opt or outright steal a movement and they pretend it’s yours. Pirates do that stuff.Locking the doors when Black people walk by your cars. You don’t have to say a word. The locks locking as we pass by your vehicles tell us exactly how you feel about us. I’m trying to go into the store and get my salad stuff for dinner. I’m not thinking about entering your car. Our minds aren’t on you, your car, or whatever you believe is valuable. Decenter yourselves please and stop being afraid of people already. Most Black people’s parents have taught them early on there’s a very high price to pay if a White person accuses you of something. We aren’t trying to ruin our lives.Clutching your purses when I walk by. No matter how broke I am or how empty my bank account is, I never, EVER think of robbing you. You don’t have to clutch anything when I pass.Not moving on the sidewalk. I know you see me right. They made normal sidewalks for two people to walk on, in two different directions, at the same time. Why do you all feel I need to move for you, especially women? If you’re walking with your little White friend, how about one of you kindly move to the back or front and not inconvenience the person walking in the correct direction? I notice you White ladies I’m talking about never move, and you never think of moving. You stay in your place expecting the Black person to move out of your way. I see you flexing your White girl card from 1760.Blocking aisles in stores. I know see me trying to get by, yet you stand in the aisles and read your packages or text on your phone exercising all your White privilege. It makes you look like a racist. At the very least your parents raised a spoiled brat who has grown up to become a very inconsiderate adult. Move over, please. You gotta share this world with us. I know your parents probably told you it was yours and you can do anything you want. Well, you can’t!Not moving when I say excuse me. Not sure what that’s about, but if excuse me isn’t enough to make you move, I don’t know what else to do. Guess you’re waiting on me to bump you as I pass by so you can call the cops and say I assaulted you. What in the hell? If you’d stop ignoring us, being irritated by us, or acting like we don’t exist maybe you’d hear our excuse me’s and would move accordingly. It happens too often to be just a coincidence. You’re taught you don’t have to move while, we’re taught good manners to avoid your wrath. Could you all please work on being more self-aware and more aware of our efforts to move politely throughout the world? We’d appreciate.Act like our saviors on the interweb. I know you’re used to saving us. Many of you have been taught early White people need to correct us non-White people because we are genetically inferior. We have our own minds; we have our own thoughts, and we see your actions and behaviors differently. Some of us don’t see you all as saviors, we see you as problems and major obstacles to progress upward mobility, and equality. Your savior views aren’t the right views, just White views.White people will flip out on us in a heartbeat, like as soon as we call them out for their racism or centering Whiteness. It’s always shocking. Always hurtful, but always expected. I’m shocked when a White person doesn’t get angry and/or flip out. It shows us you’re matured in your anti-racism walk.Closing doors in my face. It doesn’t matter if you hurry and up so the door can close in my face. I’m STILL coming into that space behind you. Your racist little microaggressions don’t go unnoticed. It signals you don’t respect me and you are not conscious of my being because I’m not White. We get the picture.Show their children anything non-White is bad/strange. I see how your kids act when you haven’t exposed them to “different” people enough. They act like they’ve seen a ghost when I get close to them. Heavens forbid if I speak or smile. Your kids act like I’m getting ready to kidnap them or like my Black may rub off. They act just the way you taught them to. Your kids look at me and other Black folks in fear like we’re aliens. Visit places of color and interact with people from different ethnic groups to become true global citizens.Don’t listen, can’t hear either. Self explanatory. You don’t listen to anyone except White people, even if they are wrong, because you only respect the voices and views of White people. When non-White people try to tell you how we feel, just be quiet and listen. If you’re a decent parent, would you slap your kid, watch him/her cry, tell them to shut up, then not want to hear why the kid was angry about what you did to them later on sometime? You can’t beat people down and oppress them, then expect them to be silent.Rewrite history. Some White people never see what Black people see, and they always have a different version of our national history, especially how this nation has treated non-White people.Talk to us disrespectfully online. Can’t tell you how tired I am of White women and men calling me crazy, reinterpreting my words, creating new definitions for the dictionaries their own people created, and talking to me and other Black people in ways we aren’t taught to speak to other adults. Our parents teach us at an early age not to speak to White people any kind of way because we’d be beaten, killed, or imprisoned. That physical power dynamic you once held has evolved into cyber-bullying Black people online. It’s another way you show how little respect you have for others and how much privilege you posses. Some of you White men are extremely condescending, and we know you do it intentionally to intimidate and bully.Put money over humanity. Many White people choose their money over humanity. You’ll get on television and boldly share you will support anyone who will help you get richer, even if that person is for killing your Black or Brown neighbors and co-workers. It’s hard to unsee how quickly White folks will stab a Black in the back for the potential of growing $5,000 in imaginary money in a 401K, then turn around and tell us they believe in equal rights and fairness. That’s cognitive dissonance buddy. America’s obsessions with wealth is bringing us down. You can’t consume or retire your way out of this mess.Ask me to trust you. You consistently ask me to trust you and your leadership choices when you know they don’t care about me or my issues. Every time we Black folks trust White people to do the right thing for us when they have power or are in positions of trust, they find a way to benefit from that position for personal or collective gain. White people often benefit from our suffering caused by inequality, and they seem unfazed about it. It’s hard to trust with the history we have together and the lack of effort to stop doing the things that create distrust. There are some good, trustworthy White people in the world. You need to stop being bullied and shamed by the bad people. Speak up.Strongly suggest who we should vote for. We used to vote to make you happy, but we’re learning our interests are really different from your. Some of you vote in ways that harm us directly and indirectly. You all even vote to hurt yourselves as long as someone you dislike is hurt in the process. Again, how can we trust your decisions if you all just bark orders without taking into consideration what we need? Inequality makes us see things differently. When we start seeing you make sacrifices instead of calculated risks politically and financially, perhaps we will begin to feel better about your decision-making.Forget my name. Funny how you can remember the pretty White girl’s name and face, but me, not so much. Love that. I just love that. We either all look alike or you’ve been conditioned by your sanitized environments to believe if it’s a Black face, it’s not important. We remember you, but for different reasons. Sometimes it’s for our own protection or because we must rely on you. I used to go to church with White folks Sunday who would hug me on Sunday and walk right past me in Walmart afterwards like they didn’t know me. If having relationships with Black people matters to you, remembering our faces and names would really help.Asking me for help when I’m trying to shopping. I am not the help. Before you open your mouths to ask me where something is in the store, look at my clothes, look at the purse on my arm, look to see I don’t have store frocks on my butt for goodness sake. Go look around or go find someone who looks like they actually belong to the store instead of assuming every Brown face works to serve you. I see White people do it all the time.Sometimes I really wonder what’s on your mind when ya’ll do that old antebellum mess. I know you may feel it’s not a big deal, but there is a history behind your actions. Ask yourselves why you stop to ask the Black or Brown people first.Whitesplain. Please stop. I know what I think. I know how to speak. I know what I want to say. I know how I feel. Don’t tell me how to do any of these things and please don’t challenge me if I don’t see eye to eye with you. It’s okay for us to disagree, and we know that’s very hard for many White people to accept. Sometimes you should just move on instead of injecting yourselves into Black conversations if you can’t add value. We don’t need you to come redirecting traffic to recenter everything on you. Besides, you make people not want to engage which encourages ignorance. It also silences minorities who would love to talk too. I love healthy dialogue. I like disagreement. I dislike how some of you speak to me, your tone, and your need to micromanage our words and thoughts.Backstabbing and ignoring me in the workplace. I have never worked on a job where White women haven’t stabbed me in my back, stole my ideas, sabotaged my nonprofit, or undermined me when I was a supervisor. Never. Women are the biggest workplace bullies because their indirect shenanigans go unseen or tolerated as women just being women. White women you’re the icing on the bully cake too often.Too many of you think you don’t have to answer to Black women or respect us, and you’d rather tear us down than to help a sister out. I also hate when I suggest something and it’s ignored by a group of White people, but when White Bob or White Jane suggests the same thing, you all hear it and think it’s a wonderful idea. It shows you don’t listen to or hear Black people in your White spaces. Backstabbing in the workplace creates inequality and division. It’s evil too. Just stop please.Suspect and harass us. I’m riding on the elevator and here comes Elevator Ellen telling another White women on the elevator she needed to be careful. Ain’t I a woman? We can hardly do anything or go anywhere without being suspected of something. You’ve been trained to gaze us differently. Please retrain yourselves.Ignore the diversity and inclusions initiatives you create. Nothing pisses me off more than White people creating workplace and program initiatives to bring more diversity and inclusion, then you all undermine your own diversity and inclusion efforts by engaging in tokenism and allowing White people to be overtly racist without being checked. Diversity does not address equality/inequality in pay or hiring. We’re tired of your performative diversity and inclusion efforts. It’s not improving the pay gap. Either you’re for equality or not. Intentionally sprinkling Black and Brown people around the office isn’t doing anything to achieve equality. It’s just making a white space a little dingy.Engage in tokenism in television and entertainment. If I had a dollar for every time, I watched a television show with a truckload of White people and only one little Black or Brown person, I’d be rich. Tokenism is the equivalent of the diversity and inclusion illusion. While you’re busy being colorblind, I can see your lack of color inclusion in your lives. When I see tokenism in action on my television or hear it on my radio, I know immediately who wrote the script for it. Period. One in a sea of White is not diversity. It’s tokenism.Appropriate our culture. Many of you hate our Black and Brown skins, but you love our words, our slang, music, food, and styles. Nothing burns me up more than seeing your children disrespecting and fearing us saying we’re bad, but you’ll allow the to wear the same clothes, hats, and shoes we wear, the way we wear them. I’m saddened by your kids using Black slang from our music, and yet you teach them we are inferior, you teach the to disrespect culture. You teach them it’s okay to cross the line to look like they hang around Black kids but they don’t really have to. Funny how we’re bad for you until we’re good for you.Get scared if too many Black people are in any space you’re in. You should see your faces. Watching your unnecessary angst is hilarious. They way you hold on to your kids, and all the extra stuff you do to prepare to come to our spaces is too much. If you came around more often, you wouldn’t be so afraid. We’re not afraid when we must venture into your spaces even though you guys do a lot to keep intimidate the hell out of us when we’re there. Go get some therapy. Attend anti-racism trainings. Go to Black spaces. Get some Black friends and go sit in their homes. Read White anti-racism authors like Robin DiAngelo, Tim Wise, or the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Teaching Tolerance. Face your fears, don’t hide from them.Not speak when I live in your neighborhood. I know many of you hate to see us move in to your little neighborhoods still in 2020 because you’ve been taught we make your community’s value go down. Who came up with that bullshit? I wave like a good neighbor, and ya’ll be acting like I’m not there. How Un-State Farm of you. As long as you all are hoarding up all the tax money from property taxes and determining which communities get the best stuff, we are coming. So move over, smile, and wave or learn how to share resources so we all have the same things.The list of White people things is much longer than this. I just have to stop because people have short-attention spans and a limited amount of time to spend reading. If you made it this far, I’m sure you’re pissed. If you are, that’s nice. Remember that feelings the next time you see one of us sharing spaces with you.If you have things to add to this list, regardless of your race or role, please do. Let’s talk it out. Equality starts with the small things, like changing your mindset so that it’s easier to behave differently. Actions speak louder than words.And for those of you who may read this and need to defend and/or dismiss these behaviors as rude White people just being rude White people, please kindly read my accompanying piece below “The Privilege of Being An Asshole Without Consequences.” Many people of color don’t get the privilege of being an asshole. Please understand your privileges, examine your behavior, and if necessary, act accordingly. It’s a matter of public health.https://medium.com/marleyisms/privilege-of-being-an-asshole-without-consequences-398fa5523182MarleyWritten by"
20,Learn How To Focus Like The Pros,"I can’t count how many times I’ve heard people make excuses for their attention span. “My attention span is, like, two seconds.” “I’m just so ADHD.” “I can’t just sit down and work for six hours in a row.” “I’m like a squirrel — hey look, squirrel!” Our culture sees our attention spans as something fixed, immutable, like hair color and eye color: something you either have or don’t have.Like most of our cultural narratives, this is total bullshit. The reason you can’t focus is that no one ever taught you how.One thing not many people know about me is that I was raised in a household with two autistic brothers. I don’t mean a little autistic — you know, a little awkward, social delays, periodic obsessions — I mean a lot autistic. My childhood memories are not of going to soccer practice, but of sitting in the waiting rooms of speech therapy clinics for my brothers. The state sent medical professionals to our house for four to six hours a day, five to seven days a week, to teach one of my brothers basic skills, skills like using the bathroom and asking for food. As a result, I knew more about how to live with intellectual and mental disabilities by age 12 than many medical professionals themselves do.The one lesson this taught me, more than any other, is that there is always a workaround. If he couldn’t form the words to ask for food, my parents could print out little pictures of his favorite foods he could point to. If he couldn’t figure out the name of the movie he wanted to watch, my mother could teach him how to put in the tapes himself. If he couldn’t stomach store-bought chicken nuggets, my grandparents could make him chicken nuggets that wouldn’t upset his stomach.In the medical parlance, these are called interventions — specialists intervening on behalf of the disabled person.So when I started displaying symptoms of ADHD around age 13 — an inability to remember my class schedule, let alone my homework assignments, a constant fidgety feeling in class, the nasty habit of reading a book for ten hours straight and forgetting to eat and go to the bathroom —I didn’t ask a parent for help. I didn’t tell my teachers I couldn’t remember what the assignment was. The solution was obvious: develop a workaround. So at age 13, I became the only student with a day planner, calendar, and to-do list.My friends called me a nerd. My teachers thought I was just so responsible (until I brought a Palm Pilot to class — then they called me a distraction). I didn’t know what was wrong with me; I knew I didn’t care about school all that much, but I didn’t know how to tell anyone that I needed my hyper-organized binders and my day planner and my todo list and my Palm Pilot or I was going to melt down. It was eight years before a therapist correctly identified these as good interventions for severe ADHD.By then, of course, I had already realized. Not only have I been using a calendar and to-do list since age 13, I’ve been using a matrix of coping mechanisms since my early adulthood:I’m sure there’s more… if only I could remember them.These interventions work — for people with ADHD, and for anyone — because they reduce the load on your working memory.Working memory is a cognitive system with a limited capacity that is responsible for temporarily holding information available for processing. Working memory is important for reasoning and the guidance of decision-making and behavior. Working memory is often used synonymously with short-term memory, but some theorists consider the two forms of memory distinct, assuming that working memory allows for the manipulation of stored information, whereas short-term memory only refers to the short-term storage of information. — Wikipedia, Working MemoryWhen someone asks you to remember some numbers, that’s a load on your working memory. When you just remember everything you need to get done in your head, that’s a load on your working memory. When you just remember your schedule in your head instead of putting it in your calendar, that’s a load on your working memory.The bad news is that your working memory is not infinite. Like RAM on a computer, too much information packed in your working memory will cause space shortages. Eventually, data gets deleted. For your working memory to perform well, it needs the most space possible. When people keep to-do lists, calendars, and binders of information, that’s what they’re doing — freeing up their working memory for more important things.Unfortunately, our brains didn’t evolve for modern life. The demand modern environments place on our working memory is incredible. In addition to the normal todos, scheduled events, and information you need to remember, there’s sensory information like:To get even a minimally acceptable level of performance out of your working memory, you have to fight a torrent of stimuli. In modern society, nobody has a long attention span unless they do what it takes to have one.So, when I hear people complain about their ability to focus, to remember names, to remember things they need to get done, I immediately take a look at them and ask myself “what interventions are they using?”When people tell me they have the attention span of a fish, the first thing I ask myself is if they have a to-do list or a calendar. If they don’t, I think “no, your attention span is fine” — because if your attention span is short and you don’t have a calendar and to-do list, you will have a hard time getting your life together.The first (and most basic) thing you can do to increase your ability to focus is getting a to-do list and a calendar and using them every day.Of all the ways modern life is distracting, the phone is clearly the champion — your phone processes hundreds of notifications a day, all of them constantly vying for your attention.So, if you tell me you have the attention span of a fish and I see your phone’s lock screen is completely filled with notifications, I am going to think the only reason you’re distracted is that you let yourself be distracted.If you want to be able to focus, turn your phone notifications off. Like, all of them. Not just when you’re working, but all the time. The only notifications I get for my phone are for:That’s it. No games, no social media (in fact, I deleted all of it), no news, no podcasts, no nothing. I can’t afford to have my phone distracting me when I’m trying to focus.Everything you own produces a cognitive load. Every possession you own is something you have to look at, think about, process, clean, rearrange, and take care of. And like your phone notifications, you don’t notice the cognitive load until it’s completely out of your control.For maximum working memory, own only things you use regularly. You don’t have to pare down all your possessions to one backpack James Altucher style, but you should be able to fit all your possessions in your own home without the aid of walk-in-closets, complicated closet systems from The Container Store, or an external storage unit. That’s not minimalism, that’s common sense.What’s also important is that things are out of sight; we operate at peak capacity when we have a clean, uncluttered, simple space that allows us to focus on what’s in front of us (instead of the random clutter around us). If you can put all your papers, books, clothes, and possessions either away in drawers or organized on shelves, your working memory will thank you.P.S. If you have anything sitting around the house you are going to donate, resell, or “fix up,” either get it done or get rid of them. Items like this are just physical to-dos, distracting you with their needs every time you lay eyes on them. Remove the distraction once and for all.Just like how your phone notifications cause sensory overload, your email does as well. It’s hard to know what you’ve got going on in your life when your inbox is an endless pile of things you haven’t dealt with. The good news is, cleaning out your email is simple business:These are common ways people ease the load on their working memory, but they are not the only ways. Anything in your life that represents something you have to keep track of, for five minutes or five months, is something weighing on your working memory. The easier you can make it on your working memory, the better.Your working memory will not instantaneously improve the moment you start doing these things. If anything, your working memory will get worse — now you have to remember to update your todo list and calendar, check your phone manually, etc. These habits will take time to build. But after two or three weeks, the habits will stick, and your working memory will increase dramatically.This is because, like your muscles, your working memory needs to be trained. It doesn’t improve or get worse instantaneously. Instead, it needs time and space to grow.In “How to Remove Facebook From Your Life,” writer Dan Silvestre notes how deleting his Facebook account produced an increase in his own working memory:Similarly how smokers breath better every week after they quit, the increase in my attention span was incremental. At first, it was hard to focus for more than a handful minutes on a task. Gradually, it became easier and I am now a lot better at doing Deep Work for a longer period of time.My own story is somewhat similar. Over the course of a few months…Then I noticed something happened all on its own, like a miracle from heaven — I could remember people’s names. All my life, I couldn’t remember to even feed myself, let alone remember people’s names, and suddenly now I’m the person everyone asks for name reminders. In fact, the original title for this article was “How To Always Remember People’s Names.”But it’s not just names. I can remember all kinds of things. I remember new people’s names the first time. I remember where my boyfriend put his keys when he came in the house. I remember the great idea I had in the shower. I remember the way to get out of neighborhoods I’ve never been to before. My God, I remember.When I combine all my newly-available working memory with the hours of time I’ve reclaimed from my phone and social media and email, my productivity goes insane.It’s not because I’m so smart, or super-motivated, or blessed with a neurotypical brain (I’m arguably smart, but I’m not always motivated and I’m definitely not neurotypical). It’s because, instead of just consigning myself to a life with a poor attention span, I did something about it.The good news is, if a woman with ADHD so severe she forgets to eat can figure out how to get hours of uninterrupted productivity on a regular basis, so can you.If you want more articles like this, sign up for my weekly digest.Click to join Megan’s Weekly Digest today.Written by"
21,"9 Free Programming Courses by Harvard, MIT, IBM, Google, and Microsoft","A traditional degree can be costly, especially if you’re thinking about a career change or don’t want to rack up a large student loan. While community colleges and local institutions tend to be much lower in cost, you might be unsure about such a long-term commitment or have family-related logistics to coordinate. Or maybe you just want to formally upgrade your skills without taking three years off.Here are nine courses where you can learn coding for free. The best part is that you can also get certified by ivy league institutes or industry leaders like Google, AWS, Microsoft, and IBM.For the courses listed here, learning the content and completing the associated materials is often free but getting the accreditation for it can cost a little, depending on the provider and institution.Course by HarvardX.This certificate contains one course that’s broken up into two parts. Both parts are free. The price of a verified certificate is about the same as a week’s worth of groceries for one person, so it’s not too bad.The first part covers the introductory component to web programming and touches on C, Python, SQL, JavaScript, CSS and HTML. The second part deals with more in-depth topics and includes Git, using APIs, SQL, scalability, testing, and various front end technologies.All in all, the entire course can be completed in approximately 20 weeks. But, because it’s self-paced, it can be completed faster.Course by HarvardX.This is another professional certificate by Harvard University via EdX. The first part of this course is the same as above — the second half sends you down a mobile application specialty with React Native.If you’re looking specifically to get into front end development, the previously listed course is better suited. But if you’re looking to have cross-functional skills with mobile development, then this track may be right for you.Whatever you end up choosing, you can still do the other path in conjunction since the content will eventually crop up in real-life scenarios.Course by Microsoft.This course is a bit more expensive to complete. However, it consists of 11 different courses with a focus on Python. Each course has its own certified certificate, with all 11 adding up to a professional certificate from Microsoft.It’s self-paced and the expected workload is approximately 4–6 hours per week — or an hour a night if you’re looking to slowly digest the content. Because it’s self-paced you can finish it faster if you have more time you can devote to it.The course includes deep learning, ethics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.Course by Microsoft.This certification consists of three courses and deals mainly with Python. The program is aimed at absolute beginners, which means that you’re not expected to know anything at all about programming.It’s 100% self-paced and you can work through the program without needing to pay anything for access.If you’re looking for a starting foundational course, the free content in this one can help kickstart your career in tech. However, it’s important to note that this course is very Python-centric — which isn’t a bad thing, but if you’re looking for a general course, perhaps because your mind is better suited to generalist ways of learning, then the Harvard courses may be better for you.Course by Massachusetts Institute of Technology.This is another beginner course, aimed at people who want to get started and test the waters with programming but don’t know where to start.The length of time required to complete this program (estimated at 5 months 14–16 hours per week commitment) suggests that the program is meatier in content.The program overview says that you don’t need prior experience in computer science-related subjects and topics to get started. This means you’ll learn the important concepts that make up the foundation of computational thinking.Course by Google Cloud.Cloud computing is the flavor of the coming decade and this course was created by Google to help you understand and work with their technologies.You’ll learn about infrastructure, the core services Google offers, how they work, as well as concepts and theories about cloud computing.This course is suited for those who already have some programming skills and want to upgrade into a true full-stack developer.Just because they can boot up something in the cloud, it doesn’t instantly make you a true full-stack developer. Cloud infrastructure and architecture is a complex creature, as complex as all the other parts of development work, and this certification track can bolster your knowledge and make you a better full stack developer.Course by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.The courses in this track are part of their Master in Computer Science degree. However, the content track for this certification is geared toward becoming an expert in cloud computing theories and technologies.It also touches on big data and how to deal with it in the cloud.This track is not for beginners and is better suited to those who already have experience in development work and maybe some years working with applications. It’s more of an upgrading of skill and knowledge.Course by IBM.This course is created by IBM and aimed at beginners looking to get a better understanding of cybersecurity and how application building processes work.The course content deals with security protocols, cybersecurity frameworks, and how cyber-attacks happen.Security is often one of the last things on people’s minds — until something happens. Then the magnificent Captain Hindsight kicks in! Having a good foundation in security that can help prevent these kinds of occurrences.You don’t have to be a coder to start this program, or even be looking to learn how to code. Rather, this course is suitable for all, regardless of your current discipline.Course by University at Buffalo and The State University of New York.Who isn’t talking about blockchain nowadays? It’s everywhere. But the issue with blockchain is that while there’s a lot of hype, a lot of people don’t really know what it is, what it does, or how it works.This is your chance to upgrade your skillset and get started on something that’s being touted as the next frontier of technology. It’s a different way of thinking about programming and how to create applications.Blockchain is a revolution in action and this is your opportunity to be part of it.Taking a structured course can help you get out of the self-taught route and take you out of the tutorial rut by giving you a structure to topics and idea paths that you may not be aware of.The main perk of the courses listed above is that they’re all free. That means that unless you want the certificate for showing purposes, the knowledge itself is free. The only cost is the initial time investment you put in.Becoming a crafter of code is a constant act of learning. It doesn’t matter where you are in your journey right now, learning is an activity that all the best developers have in common.Edit: For people who are saying there are no links, click on the title of the course.

22,Building a Simple Chatbot from Scratch in Python (using NLTK),"Gartner estimates that by 2020, chatbots will be handling 85 percent of customer-service interactions; they are already handling about 30 percent of transactions now.I am sure you’ve heard about Duolingo: a popular language-learning app, which gamifies practicing a new language. It is quite popular due to its innovative styles of teaching a foreign language.The concept is simple: five to ten minutes of interactive training a day is enough to learn a language.However, even though Duolingo is enabling people to learn a new language, it’s practitioners had a concern. People felt they were missing out on learning valuable conversational skills since they were learning on their own. People were also apprehensive about being paired with other language learners due to fear of embarrassment. This was turning out be a big bottleneck in Duolingo’s plans.So their team solved this problem by building a native chatbot within its app, to help users learn conversational skills and practice what they learned.Since the bots are designed as conversational and friendly, Duolingo learners can practice conversation any time of the day, using their choice of characters, until they feel brave enough to practice their new language with other speakers. This solved a major consumer pain point and made learning through the app a lot more fun.A chatbot is an artificial intelligence-powered piece of software in a device (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant etc), application, website or other networks that try to gauge consumer’s needs and then assist them to perform a particular task like a commercial transaction, hotel booking, form submission etc . Today almost every company has a chatbot deployed to engage with the users. Some of the ways in which companies are using chatbots are:The possibilities are (almost) limitless.History of chatbots dates back to 1966 when a computer program called ELIZA was invented by Weizenbaum. It imitated the language of a psychotherapist from only 200 lines of code. You can still converse with it here: Eliza.There are broadly two variants of chatbots: Rule-Based and Self-learning.i) In retrieval-based models, a chatbot uses some heuristic to select a response from a library of predefined responses. The chatbot uses the message and context of the conversation for selecting the best response from a predefined list of bot messages. The context can include a current position in the dialogue tree, all previous messages in the conversation, previously saved variables (e.g. username). Heuristics for selecting a response can be engineered in many different ways, from rule-based if-else conditional logic to machine learning classifiers.ii) Generative bots can generate the answers and not always replies with one of the answers from a set of answers. This makes them more intelligent as they take word by word from the query and generates the answers.In this article we will build a simple retrieval based chatbot based on NLTK library in python.Hands-On knowledge of scikit library and NLTK is assumed. However, if you are new to NLP, you can still read the article and then refer back to resources.The field of study that focuses on the interactions between human language and computers is called Natural Language Processing, or NLP for short. It sits at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics[Wikipedia].NLP is a way for computers to analyze, understand, and derive meaning from human language in a smart and useful way. By utilizing NLP, developers can organize and structure knowledge to perform tasks such as automatic summarization, translation, named entity recognition, relationship extraction, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and topic segmentation.NLTK(Natural Language Toolkit) is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries.NLTK has been called “a wonderful tool for teaching and working in, computational linguistics using Python,” and “an amazing library to play with natural language.”Natural Language Processing with Python provides a practical introduction to programming for language processing. I highly recommend this book to people beginning in NLP with Python.Downloading and installing NLTKFor platform-specific instructions, read here.import NLTK and run nltk.download().This will open the NLTK downloader from where you can choose the corpora and models to download. You can also download all packages at once.The main issue with text data is that it is all in text format (strings). However, Machine learning algorithms need some sort of numerical feature vector in order to perform the task. So before we start with any NLP project we need to pre-process it to make it ideal for work. Basic text pre-processing includes:The NLTK data package includes a pre-trained Punkt tokenizer for English.After the initial preprocessing phase, we need to transform the text into a meaningful vector (or array) of numbers. The bag-of-words is a representation of text that describes the occurrence of words within a document. It involves two things:•A vocabulary of known words.•A measure of the presence of known words.Why is it is called a “bag” of words? That is because any information about the order or structure of words in the document is discarded and the model is only concerned with whether the known words occur in the document, not where they occur in the document.The intuition behind the Bag of Words is that documents are similar if they have similar content. Also, we can learn something about the meaning of the document from its content alone.For example, if our dictionary contains the words {Learning, is, the, not, great}, and we want to vectorize the text “Learning is great”, we would have the following vector: (1, 1, 0, 0, 1).A problem with the Bag of Words approach is that highly frequent words start to dominate in the document (e.g. larger score), but may not contain as much “informational content”. Also, it will give more weight to longer documents than shorter documents.One approach is to rescale the frequency of words by how often they appear in all documents so that the scores for frequent words like “the” that are also frequent across all documents are penalized. This approach to scoring is called Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, or TF-IDF for short, where:Term Frequency: is a scoring of the frequency of the word in the current document.Inverse Document Frequency: is a scoring of how rare the word is across documents.Tf-IDF weight is a weight often used in information retrieval and text mining. This weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpusExample:Consider a document containing 100 words wherein the word ‘phone’ appears 5 times.The term frequency (i.e., tf) for phone is then (5 / 100) = 0.05. Now, assume we have 10 million documents and the word phone appears in one thousand of these. Then, the inverse document frequency (i.e., IDF) is calculated as log(10,000,000 / 1,000) = 4. Thus, the Tf-IDF weight is the product of these quantities: 0.05 * 4 = 0.20.Tf-IDF can be implemented in scikit learn as:from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizerTF-IDF is a transformation applied to texts to get two real-valued vectors in vector space. We can then obtain the Cosine similarity of any pair of vectors by taking their dot product and dividing that by the product of their norms. That yields the cosine of the angle between the vectors. Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors. Using this formula we can find out the similarity between any two documents d1 and d2.where d1,d2 are two non zero vectors.For a detailed explanation and practical example of TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity refer to the document below.Now we have a fair idea of the NLP process. It is time that we get to our real task i.e Chatbot creation. We will name the chatbot here as ‘ROBO🤖’.You can find the entire code with the corpus at the associated Github Repository here or you can view it on my binder by clicking the image below.For our example, we will be using the Wikipedia page for chatbots as our corpus. Copy the contents from the page and place it in a text file named ‘chatbot.txt’. However, you can use any corpus of your choice.We will read in the corpus.txt file and convert the entire corpus into a list of sentences and a list of words for further pre-processing.Let see an example of the sent_tokens and the word_tokensWe shall now define a function called LemTokens which will take as input the tokens and return normalized tokens.Next, we shall define a function for a greeting by the bot i.e if a user’s input is a greeting, the bot shall return a greeting response.ELIZA uses a simple keyword matching for greetings. We will utilize the same concept here.To generate a response from our bot for input questions, the concept of document similarity will be used. So we begin by importing the necessary modules.This will be used to find the similarity between words entered by the user and the words in the corpus. This is the simplest possible implementation of a chatbot.We define a function response which searches the user’s utterance for one or more known keywords and returns one of several possible responses. If it doesn’t find the input matching any of the keywords, it returns a response:” I am sorry! I don’t understand you”Finally, we will feed the lines that we want our bot to say while starting and ending a conversation depending upon the user’s input.So that’s pretty much it. We have coded our first chatbot in NLTK. Now, let us see how it interacts with humans:This wasn’t too bad. Even though the chatbot couldn’t give a satisfactory answer for some questions, it fared pretty well on others.Though it is a very simple bot with hardly any cognitive skills, its a good way to get into NLP and get to know about chatbots.Though ‘ROBO’ responds to user input. It won’t fool your friends, and for a production system you’ll want to consider one of the existing bot platforms or frameworks, but this example should help you think through the design and challenge of creating a chatbot. Internet is flooded with resources and after reading this article I am sure , you will want to create a chatbot of your own. So happy tinkering!!Written by"
23,A Simple Guide On Using BERT for Binary Text Classification.,"In light of the update to the library used in this article (HuggingFace updated the pytorch-pretrained-bert library to pytorch-transformers), I have written a new guide as well as a new repo. If you are starting out with Transformer models, I recommend using those as the code has been cleaned up both on my end and in the Pytorch-Transformers library, greatly streamlining the whole process. The new repo also supports XLNet, XLM, and RoBERTa models out of the box, in addition to BERT, as of September 2019.That said, everything in this article, and its accompanying repo, still work as intended for anyone wishing to use them.Before we begin, let me point you towards the github repo containing all the code used in this guide. All code in the repo is included in the guide here, and vice versa. Feel free to refer to it anytime, or clone the repo to follow along with the guide.If your internet wanderings have led you here, I guess it’s safe to assume that you have heard of BERT, the powerful new language representation model, open-sourced by Google towards the end of 2018. If you haven’t, or if you’d like a refresher, I recommend giving their paper a read as I won’t be going into the technical details of how BERT works. If you are unfamiliar with the Transformer model (or if words like “attention”, “embeddings”, and “encoder-decoder” sound scary), check out this brilliant article by Jay Alammar. You don’t necessarily need to know everything about BERT (or Transformers) to follow the rest of this guide, but the above links should help if you wish to learn more about BERT and Transformers.Now that we’ve gotten what we won’t do out of the way, let’s dig into what we will do, shall we?One last thing before we dig in, I’ll be using three Jupyter Notebooks for data preparation, training, and evaluation. It’s not strictly necessary, but it felt cleaner to separate those three processes.Most datasets you find will typically come in the csv format and the Yelp Reviews dataset is no exception. Let’s load it in with pandas and take a look.As you can see, the data is in the two csv files train.csv and test.csv. They contain no headers, and two columns for the label and the text. The labels used here feel a little weird to me, as they have used 1 and 2 instead of the typical 0 and 1. Here, a label of 1 means the review is bad, and a label of 2 means the review is good. I’m going to change this to the more familiar 0 and 1 labelling, where a label 0 indicates a bad review, and a label 1 indicates a good review.BERT, however, wants data to be in a tsv file with a specific format as given below (Four columns, and no header row).Let’s make things a little BERT-friendly.For convenience, I’ve named the test data as dev data. The convenience stems from the fact that BERT comes with data loading classes that expects train and dev files in the above format. We can use the train data to train our model, and the dev data to evaluate its performance. BERT’s data loading classes can also use a test file but it expects the test file to be unlabelled. Therefore, I will be using the train and dev files instead.Now that we have the data in the correct form, all we need to do is to save the train and dev data as .tsv files.That’s the eggs beaten, the chicken thawed, and the veggies sliced. Let’s get cooking!Now, we will see the reason for us rearranging the data into the .tsv format in the previous section. It enables us to easily reuse the example classes that come with BERT for our own binary classification task. Here’s how they look.The first class, InputExample, is the format that a single example of our dataset should be in. We won’t be using the text_b attribute since that is not necessary for our binary classification task. The other attributes should be fairly self-explanatory.The other two classes, DataProcessor and BinaryClassificationProcessor, are helper classes that can be used to read in .tsv files and prepare them to be converted into features that will ultimately be fed into the actual BERT model.The BinaryClassificationProcessor class can read in the train.tsv and dev.tsv files and convert them into lists of InputExample objects.So far, we have the capability to read in tsv datasets and convert them into InputExample objects. BERT, being a neural network, cannot directly deal with text as we have in InputExample objects. The next step is to convert them into InputFeatures.BERT has a constraint on the maximum length of a sequence after tokenizing. For any BERT model, the maximum sequence length after tokenization is 512. But we can set any sequence length equal to or below this value. For faster training, I’ll be using 128 as the maximum sequence length. A bigger number may give better results if there are sequences longer than this value.An InputFeature consists of purely numerical data (with the proper sequence lengths) that can then be fed into the BERT model. This is prepared by tokenizing the text of each example and truncating the longer sequence while padding the shorter sequences to the given maximum sequence length (128). I found the conversion of InputExample objects to InputFeature objects to be quite slow by default, so I modified the conversion code to utilize the multiprocessing library of Python to significantly speed up the process.We will see how to use these methods in just a bit.(Note: I’m switching to the training notebook.)First, let’s import all the packages that we’ll need, and then get our paths straightened out.In the first cell, we are importing the necessary packages. In the next cell, we are setting some paths for where files should be stored and where certain files can be found. We are also setting some configuration options for the BERT model. Finally, we will create the directories if they do not already exist.Next, we will use our BinaryClassificationProcessor to load in the data, and get everything ready for the tokenization step.Here, we are creating our BinaryClassificationProcessor and using it to load in the train examples. Then, we are setting some variables that we’ll use while training the model. Next, we are loading the pretrained tokenizer by BERT. In this case, we’ll be using the bert-base-cased model.The convert_example_to_feature function expects a tuple containing an example, the label map, the maximum sequence length, a tokenizer, and the output mode. So lastly, we will create an examples list ready to be processed (tokenized, truncated/padded, and turned into InputFeatures) by the convert_example_to_feature function.Now, we can use the multi-core goodness of modern CPU’s to process the examples (relatively) quickly. My Ryzen 7 2700x took about one and a half hours for this part.(Note: If you have any issues getting the multiprocessing to work, just copy paste all the code up to, and including, the multiprocessing into a python script and run it from the command line or an IDE. Jupyter Notebooks can sometimes get a little iffy with multiprocessing. I’ve included an example script on github named converter.py)Once all the examples are converted into features, we can pickle them to disk for safekeeping (I, for one, do not want to run the processing for another one and a half hours). Next time, you can just unpickle the file to get the list of features.Well, that was a lot of data preparation. You deserve a coffee, I’ll see you for the training part in a bit. (Unless you already had your coffee while the processing was going on. In which case, kudos to efficiency!)Not much left now, let’s hope for smooth sailing. (Or smooth.. cooking? I forgot my analogy somewhere along the way. Anyway, we now have all the ingredients in the pot, and all we have to do is turn on the stove and let thermodynamics work its magic.)HuggingFace’s pytorch implementation of BERT comes with a function that automatically downloads the BERT model for us (have I mentioned I love these dudes?). I stopped my download since I have terrible internet, but it shouldn’t take long. It’s only about 400 MB in total for the base models. Just wait for the download to complete and you are good to go.Don’t panic if you see the following output once the model is downloaded, I know it looks panic inducing but this is actually the expected behavior. The not initialized things are not meant to be initialized. Intentionally.(Tip: The model will be downloaded into a temporary folder. Find the folder by following the path printed on the output once the download completes and copy the downloaded file to the cache/ directory. The file should be a compressed file in .tar.gz format. Next time, you can just use this downloaded file without having to download it all over again. All you need to do is comment out the line that downloaded the model, and uncomment the line below it.)We just need to do a tiny bit more configuration for the training. Here, I’m just using the default parameters.Setting up our DataLoader for training..Training time!Now we’ve trained the BERT model for one epoch, we can evaluate the results. Of course, more training will likely yield better results but even one epoch should be sufficient for proof of concept (hopefully!).In order to be able to easily load our fine-tuned model, we should save it in a specific way, i.e. the same way the default BERT models are saved. Here is how you can do that.We will load this fine tuned model in the next step.(Note: I’m switching to the evaluation notebook)Most of the code for the evaluation is very similar to the training process, so I won’t go into too much detail but I’ll list some important points.Here’s my notebook for the evaluation.With just one single epoch of training, our BERT model achieves a 0.914 Matthews correlation coefficient (Good measure for evaluating unbalanced datasets. Sklearn doc here). With more training, and perhaps some hyperparameter tuning, we can almost certainly improve upon what is already an impressive score.BERT is an incredibly powerful language representation model that shows great promise in a wide variety of NLP tasks. Here, I’ve tried to give a basic guide to how you might use it for binary text classification.As the results show, BERT is a very effective tool for binary text classification, not to mention all the other tasks it has already been used for.Reminder: Github repo with all the code can be found here.Written by"
24,I Knew I Had To Breakup With Him When I Opened His Gift,"When Pete handed me the gift, I was hesitant. It felt like a tiny stack of note cards. The wrapping paper had nothing to grip and whatever was contained within slid around alarmingly. In an instant, I knew what he had given me.At that same moment, I decided to break up with him.I’m a sucker for the holidays. The lights, the music, the trees, the incessant smell of cinnamon in the air, I love it all. Mostly, I enjoy exchanging gifts. I’m not one for being excessive, but finding that perfect present for your loved one is a challenge I readily accept.Had a passion for an obscure television show in your childhood? Thanks to the power of eBay, I was able to find that lunch box featuring its characters that you desired all those years ago. Do you use one pan with its “harmless” coating of rust for everything you cook? Here are a proper skillet and saucepan so you can actually make a good meal that won’t poison you or me.Yeah, I don’t mean to brag, but I’m pretty good at giving gifts.It’s not about the money. I don’t need diamonds or a $2500 exercise bike. The gift just needs to be something that proves the person cares enough to listen and watch for a way to make my life a little sweeter.Pete failed that test spectacularly that Christmas.To be fair, things were already rocky. We were in that weird phase of our relationship where we alternated staying at the other person’s place a few nights a week at a time. That much closeness is a good way to test the waters before you actually make the bigger jump and sign a lease together. It was a good thing we did so, for those waters we dipped our toes into proved rough and rocky.He was not into housework. Dishes were left out, pants remained on the floor, laundry went undone unless I took the time to be the mom. He’d been able to hide the worse of the mess by putting things out of eyesight, but now that I was actually the one opening the cupboards and closets, the problem was clear. The week before, after scrubbing the crusted remnants of tomato sauce out of a pan, I finally had it out with him. He needed to help out more because I refused to be Ms. Homemaker. He nodded, showing he understood.The next morning I found a dirty coffee cup in a bathroom cabinet.Opening the gift I looked at the small pile of 10 or so index cards. Hastily scrawled across each was a service he offered, free of charge.Pete will wash the dishes.Pete will do the laundry.Pete will vacuum.Pete will clean the windows.Pete will take out the trash.They were vouchers that I could cash in when I needed help. Only then would he deign to help me with the work he should have been splitting with me all along because it was not the 1950s anymore.He sat next to me with a smug smile, waiting for the, “Thank you,” I didn't want to give.This might seem like a cute gift, but the context was key.His gift told me, “My efforts around the house are a gift. That means those efforts will be rare and when I do anything at all, you should be very grateful.”He was never going to be an equal partner. I’d work to pay half the rent and utilities, then start my second shift when I got home, making things clean and nice so we’d both love our home. This wasn’t a deal where we’d split the duties the other person didn’t like. There was no talk of me doing all the dishes while he did the vacuuming. It was all on me. I’d do every last bit of housework unless I used one of the stupid coupons I’d just received.I thanked him. But I wasn’t thanking him for the vouchers. I was happy for the far better gift he’d unintentionally given me that night.I was thanking him for showing me who he really was, for opening my eyes to the future I would have if I stayed. My own delusions that the man next to me would be my forever-person were dashed. I wanted to be a girlfriend, not a mother to my partner.The next day, when I was grabbing the last of my belongings out of his place, I left those coupons behind for the next woman. Maybe she would find them cute and they’d get married and have 4 gorgeous children together, some of which would hopefully help her around the house.Or maybe, like me, those hand-scrawled promises to do better would prove her suspicions true, and she too would break up with him on December 26th.Thanks for reading!

25,German May Be The Language Of The Future,"Languages help seeing things from a different perspective.As a Spanish native speaker, I can say we give too much importance to sex. Every word is feminine or masculine and we fight because “non-binary” is difficult to consider in our language. When I learned English, I liked to see that nothing was sexualized.Learning German, I discovered two things so far:Through History, we could see that powerful people (kings and queens in Europe) used to speak French. Then, the Spanish increased their speakers when they colonized America.Now we live in an era where English dominates businesses. But, with the UK leaving the EU, and fights between China and the US, it is possible for German or Chinese to become the main language for business.Why do I think China growth will not last? Two reasons:On the other hand, Germany is one of the promoters of the EU. Lots of migrants that used to move to London are now moving to other European cities. Frankfurt, Paris, and Amsterdam are the cities attracting the most talent and investments.I have always wanted to learn German, I went to classes some years ago, but after 3 months I stopped going as I found it dull.Last year, I decided to try it again and I got to be constant all over the year. Do you want to know how I did it? Keep reading.Most shows on Netflix are in German: Queer eye, The Witcher, Rick and Morty, Sex Education,… you can set English subtitles to watch it. If you are brave enough, some series, like Rick and Morty, have German subtitles too.Some people consider that turning on English subtitles is bad because you read instead of listening, but it is worse if you do not do it at all because you are bored. I like to make little steps so I am engaged.I read Faust by Flix. You can buy it in Amazon. It’s a hilarious comic based on the classic Faust.I also bought Harry Potter und Die Kammer des Schreckens. I would listen the hörbuch while reading it and then read it again looking for the words I do not know.I admit I still find it difficult to read, but I love Harry Potter so much that I enjoyed reading it anyway. You should pick a book that you absolutely love to read it in german.I personally like to follow YouTube channels that show things that I am interested in. I like history, grammar, and music, so I just go into Google I search for “Deutsche Music Youtube”. Some of my favorites are:PS. you can set auto-translation to have English subtitles, the feature works quite well.Once, I downloaded a dating app and set my location to Hamburg. I started chatting with a girl and she taught me lots of words. It was easy as I had Google translator on my side.Let me know if you have started learning German and how it goes!Written by"
26,The Biggest Surprise For Us Out Of Trump’s Impeachment Trial,"Update: Interesting: we’re still watching C-SPAN, but they’ve changed their call-in system! Now instead of asking viewers to call different numbers based on their political affiliation, they’re asking them to call different numbers based on the time zone they’re in!Yes, former National Security Advisor John Bolton’s leaked revelation (but not by him, he insists!) that Trump’s conduct wasn’t “perfect” is quite a blockbuster, but that hasn’t touched the trial directly. At least not yet. Especially with Trump’s defense team proceeding largely as if the new info didn’t even exist: that Bolton writes in an upcoming book Trump did indeed tie military aid to Ukraine to a Biden investigation.What caught our attention — other than the fact that Trump’s folks, who are supposed to be such computer whizzes did a much poorer job presenting visual and audio support for their case than Democrats did last week: one of his lawyers at least, seemed to have access to a single perplexing template with silhouettes of a group of people over which to superimpose all of their graphics — was something not explicitly part of the trial itself.We watch the proceedings over on C-SPAN because we really dislike seeing and hearing from a panel of what Trump correctly characterizes as “8 people you never heard of” anytime there’s a break, regardless of where you turn.What C-SPAN does instead during breaks is take phone calls from its viewers, and while there’s some interaction with a host, it’s very minimal. Ostensibly to avoid confusion, C-SPAN asks Democrats, Republicans, and “Others” (whom its hosts more commonly refer to on the air as Independents), to call in to separate telephone numbers.Thing is, at least among Americans who actively call in to C-SPAN, at least over last week and the beginning of this week, almost everybody who self-identifies as an Independent, turns out to be a Trump supporter.One fellow, who identified himself as an Independent, took C-SPAN to task for being too cowardly to turn its cameras around to show Democrats slacking off during Trump’s lawyers’ arguments (of course, Republicans were doing the same thing last week). Also of course, the Senate controls its own cameras, not C-SPAN. C-SPAN in fact asked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for permission to get a camera or two of their own into the impeachment trial, specifically to get reaction shots (quite possibly of the type the “Independent” on the phone was talking about). McConnell said no.According to Gallup, as of this month 45% of voters in the U.S. self-identify as Independents. That’s close to the highest percentage ever. Conveniently, Democrats and Republicans are equally split 27%-27%. Which isn’t convenient for Democrats: they’ve historically had an edge in party registration, even in years when Republicans have won the Presidency. And the 27% who are Republicans are almost singular in their support for Trump (as he continually likes to point out), and who will almost certainly vote. The same can’t be said of the 27% of Americans who are avowed Democrats, who at best are like herding cats.Which means we’re looking at an eventuality that may be very similar to the last Presidential election: due to an uneven split among Independents, and the greater weight of the electoral vs. popular vote, a Democratic candidate might have to be polling about 10 points ahead on Election Day in order to win by a slim margin. (None of the Democratic candidates has that kind of lead over Trump in a head-to-head match-up right now. Hillary Clinton actually did, up until then-FBI Director James Comey came out and announced a second email investigation, just a few days before the election. But we know better than to go any further down that path.)At least, as we said, if Independents are accurately represented by those calling in to C-SPAN any time the Senate takes a break.Written by"

28,"Google’s New Chatbot, Aerial Surveillance, and Rooting Robots: The Week’s Most Interesting ArXiv Papers","Researchers publish hundreds of new A.I. research papers every week on arXiv, an online repository for scientific papers. Here are a few that we found interesting, and think you might, too.Google built a chatbot called Meena that was trained on 40 billion words of conversation captured from social media. Meena supposedly outperforms chatbots like Cleverbot and Microsoft’s Xiaoice by focusing on a simple metric: a crowd worker’s decision of whether its responses “makes sense.”A new approach to robotic manipulation allows a robot arm to root around, find a hidden object, and pick it up — much like the famed truffle hogs. This has obvious applications in an Amazon warehouse, where items might be dropped or buried in bins… but let’s focus on the truffle opportunities here.Today in aerial surveillance: a new way to recognize cars from satellite imagery.Bees, hornets, and mosquitoes can give scientists insight into the overall health of an ecosystem, and an international cadre of A.I. researchers have turned that idea into an app. The free app automatically recognizes different species of insect for the user, and uploads information of where they were sighted to researchers. It was an unexpected hit: users uploaded more than 44,000 images.Geoff Hinton, often credited for pioneering the math behind neural networks used in modern A.I., debuted a new algorithmic model called capsule networks in 2017. (Read how they work here.) A new paper suggests that capsule networks are better at understanding minute differences between objects than the algorithms used today.Written by"
29,Minimalism Is a Luxury Good,"Maybe it started with the iconoclastic act of throwing tea off the boat in Boston Harbor, or perhaps with the misperception that North America was simply a blank space before the pilgrims came from England and the pioneers headed West. In any case, the United States is particularly vulnerable to the charms of minimalism.Something about our belief in the power of self-definition and starting over suggests to us that if we only sweep our floors, we will magically become new people, unburdened by the past. We like to think that we can do without, rough it to prove that we’re not so soft or bound to the past. Our collective impulse to KonMari our closets is merely the most recent in a long history of nationwide cleaning fugues, from Henry David Thoreau’s cabin to the present.In 1933, the American philosopher Richard Gregg published an essay called “The Value of Voluntary Simplicity” that foretold today’s preoccupations with decluttering, unplugging, and slowing down. “We think that our machinery and technology will save us time and give us more leisure,” he wrote, “but really they make life more crowded and hurried. It is time to call a halt on endless gadgeteering.” Gregg was critiquing telephones and Henry Ford’s motorcars, but also the greed of traders in the newly ascendant stock market that had helped cause the Great Depression.The solution to this hurried life, Gregg proposed, was an ethos of “voluntary simplicity:” a “singleness of purpose, sincerity and honesty within, as well as avoidance of exterior clutter, of many possessions irrelevant to the chief purpose of life.” Voluntary simplicity emphasized “psychic goods” — art appreciation, friendship, and love, for example — over owning things. It was the 1930s answer to “buy experiences, not things.”Gregg saw voluntary simplicity as a new aesthetic system, in line with what was happening in European modernist architecture at the time. He also cited the experience of visiting a Japanese country inn that sought an overall harmony through soft colors and textures, as opposed to a western excess of furniture or interior decoration. It taught him, “There can be beauty in complexity, but complexity is not the essence of beauty.” Like Thoreau, Gregg argued that the simplicity he advocated could be found in non-Western sources: The Indian Brahman class already lived in enlightened austerity, he said, as did the “leaders of China” (an assertion that might have come as a surprise to Chinese peasants).Gregg argued that choosing simplicity could provide a kind of “psychological hygiene.” He also thought that simplicity might be a way to solve poverty, because if the privileged decided to live with less as a choice, then the poor would feel better about their own “enforced simplicity,” ridding them of their sense of inferiority and, implicitly, the compensatory impulse to buy things. This is, of course, an ineffective solution to a much deeper structural problem. And yet, we often hear a version of the same narrative today: If only the poor would spend less money, then they wouldn’t be so poor.Gregg’s essay was influential, but it took a while to become mainstream. Four decades later, in 1977, the trend forecaster and public intellectual Duane Elgin revived the concept of “voluntary simplicity” in a report of the same name, written with the social scientist and consumer futurist Arnold Mitchell. He later turned the report into a bestselling book called Voluntary Simplicity: Toward A Way of Life That Is Outwardly Simple, Inwardly Rich. It was the 1970s equivalent of Marie Kondo and has been reissued multiple times, most recently in 2010.In his years working with a government commission on population growth and then for the Stanford Research Institute, Elgin observed a trend of Americans “returning to the simple life,” which the media had turned into a new archetype. Moving to the country, baking your own bread, and establishing cooperative businesses constituted a new social philosophy, he pointed out.Elgin’s version of voluntary simplicity was driven by a sense of disconnection: Economic and political structures had grown beyond human scale, so people wanted to separate themselves from them. He linked this attitude to a kind of nationalism that he saw as positive, writing that the desire for simplicity is “reminiscent of the stubborn independence out of which was born the American Revolution.” Getting rid of stuff wasn’t only good; it was patriotic.The “sense of urgency” to simplify that Elgin documented was intensified by a familiar kind of global havoc happening at the time: the threat of chronic energy shortage, the growth of terrorism, the possibility that even before we run out of resources “we may poison ourselves to death with environmental contaminants,” and “a growing social malaise and purposelessness.” Though Elgin assigns a problematic amount of blame to the “growing demands” of “less-developed nations,” we’re still concerned with the same issues now, decades later.Elgin even predicted the social media era’s obsession with curated authenticity, the kind that we see displayed on Instagram accounts: “each person will consider whether his or her level and pattern of consumption fits, with grace and integrity, into the practical art of daily living.”As I write this, I’m sitting in the lobby of a new hotel that used to be an enormous church. Now, under the barrel-vaulted ceiling is a café counter opening onto a vaguely bohemian hang-out full of slow breakfast meetings and office-less freelancers stationed with their laptops. The old stained-glass windows have been replaced with clear panels and the pews with low, plush blue-velvet couches and black hexagonal side tables arranged in repeating configurations, as if it were the chill-out room of a disco.Online and in print, journalists have described the style of this hotel as “minimalist,” and I’m sure many visitors would agree. It has a certain aggressive cleanliness. The historical remains of the church have been erased by painting the walls pale-blue and the ceilings white. The space has been divided by glass walls and illuminated by orbs mounted on squares of brass. The ceiling is high and airy, left open above a mezzanine, the expanse only broken by a hanging geometric sculpture made out of what used to be organ pipes.The design draws attention to scale and emptiness, the volume more than the content of the architecture. The building’s religious legacy is only hinted at, as if an amusing joke. Its interior has been covered with the same deceptively simple design that can be found in coffee shops, coworking spaces, retail boutiques, and rooms on Airbnb. In order to succeed, all of these types of places need to make multiple groups of people feel comfortable. Minimalism is a perfect fit because it allows for just enough character to make a space interesting but not too much. The rest gets smoothed over into blankness.The hotel design is a cultural detective story. How did an unlikely avant-garde phenomenon become the generic luxury style of the 2010s, both an aesthetic commodity and an ascetic philosophy at the same time? It seems like a paradox, but the trend is undeniable: Google’s index of published books shows a fivefold increase in the use of “minimalism” between 1960 and 2008, moving from near-zero to mainstream. Google searches for the term also hit the tip of a massive spike at the beginning of January 2017, the digital archeological mark of the cleaning binge.The moment that I knew minimalism was truly inescapable was while catching a train in New York City’s Penn Station. A woman walked toward me wearing a black-and-white striped shirt with “minimalism” written on the chest in glittering letters like a Louis Vuitton or Supreme logo would be, as if the word meant nothing at all — which maybe it didn’t. For a while, I figured I had hallucinated the shirt, but then I discovered online that it was sold by the Gap.Omnipresence usually means a loss of specificity. There are over 13 million posts tagged with #minimalism on Instagram and around 10 new images appear every minute. Millions more are uploaded on Pinterest, where users collect inspiration for redecorating their homes or rethinking their wardrobes. Shots of the blue sky pockmarked with clouds are categorized as minimalist, as are line-drawing tattoos, wrinkled bedsheets, folded clothing, Chemex coffeemakers, spiral staircases, monochrome athleisure outfits, rustic cabins in the snow, and demure selfies.An archive of material suggests that minimalism entails a lack of patterns, blocks of solid color, organic textures, and desaturated hues. Minimalist imagery has only a few discrete subjects or focal points. The style seems adapted for the internet and social media, where every image must either compete with or match the vacuum of white website backgrounds. It looks good on the screens that contain so much of our visual experience because the abundance of blank space makes otherwise subtle qualities stand out.The veneer of minimalism becomes like an organic food label, expensive green juice, or a high-end skin treatment replacing cosmetics: It’s another class-dependent way of feeling better about yourself by buying a product. It takes a lot of money to look this simple.Ultimately, the expansion and devaluing of minimalism happened because the concept has political roots, not just aesthetic. My theory is that minimalism seems to follow social crisis, as it has in the years following the financial crash of 2008. Like Gregg and the Great Depression, Duane Elgin’s theories fit the context of the 1970s, after the social upheaval of the late 1960s had ended and the Vietnam war had come to an unjustifiable end, ejecting scarred veterans.What Gregg and Elgin critiqued — and what minimalist bloggers struggle with, though they don’t mention it by name — is the state of capitalism itself. Consumerism causes a kind of alienation, in the Marxist sense: When workers are separated from the products of their labor and compensated by an hourly wage, they can’t find satisfaction in their jobs or the remainder of family life. Thus, they turn to accumulating capital as the only form of self-fulfillment. We work only to accumulate stuff and in turn the accumulated stuff dominates us, further distancing us from noncommodified things like joy and community. Labor “is therefore not the satisfaction of a need, but only a means for satisfying needs external to it,” Karl Marx wrote in 1844.“The less you are, the less you express your own life, the more you have, the greater is your alienated life, the greater is the store of your estranged being,” Marx argued. Stuff is therefore the enemy of happiness, but not just because it’s crowding your apartment.Written by"
30,Meet the Seniors Who Do CrossFit,"“I think you can handle this,” says Karima Adi, holding out a 20-pound dumbbell. The weight is thankfully not for me — I’m still using a six-pound kettlebell — but for my workout buddy Bill Cox, a 70-year-old retiree living in London. We’re at CrossFit Shapesmiths in Clapham, where I’ve been invited to join the CrossFit Masters class for people over 60. Adi, a certified CrossFit trainer and the driving force behind the Masters class, assures me we won’t be doing any of the handstand pushups I saw people completing on my way in — at least not yet.As Bill Cox and I make our way around our parallel workouts, doing snatches, push-ups, and ring-pulls, Adi explains that the movements are similar to daily life activities: bending down to pick something off the floor, taking things off high shelves, and pulling yourself out of bed. “This is about functional movement,” she says. “My aim is to help people maintain, or restore, their natural movement,” she says. “You have to sit down and stand up for the rest of your life, and you want to make sure that you never struggle in that.”Cox, a tall man with salt and pepper hair and glasses, has been doing CrossFit for three months and he’s already advancing to lifting heavier dumbells. Like the other seniors in his Masters class, he’s here to keep his body moving so that he can live independently into old age. For Cox, CrossFit is foremost about managing the symptoms of his Parkinson’s Disease. “It’s very important to me to keep my strength up,” he says, his voicing occasionally slipping into a slight stammer due to his condition. “The physiotherapists at the hospital said I couldn’t hope to get stronger, only slow the rate that I got weaker. But that’s proven to be untrue.”Cox says he was initially apprehensive about joining CrossFit when he saw all the people lifting massive weights. But he says the group does the same exercises with smaller, more approachable weights and fewer repetitions. “That’s attractive to me, and then it builds up from where you start,” he says. “I got hooked.”“Aging is inevitable, but loss of movement, faculties, balance, agility, coordination, power and strength, is not”Despite CrossFit’s reputation as being a hardass workout regime, its focus on functional movement makes it an ideal workout for people entering their advancing years. The Masters class launched by Adi follows the usual CrossFit style workout of heavy weights and multiple rounds of exercises, but the moves are a little slower and with a bit more adjustment to allow people to go at their own pace to avoid injury. (CrossFit gyms around the world provide different offerings, and people looking for senior-focused classes should call their local gym.)“Aging is inevitable, but loss of movement, faculties, balance, agility, coordination, power and strength, is not,” says Adi.The average human lifespan has expanded, with people in developed nations routinely living into their eighties. But research shows that these longer lifespans are not necessarily accompanied by good health. Often the years at the end of a person’s life are spent in disability, or with various health conditions like cancer or heart disease. Scientists debate the ways to limit the time spent in poor health at the end of life, but one thing is clear: If you don’t use your body, it will decline.“You need to give your body signals that you need the muscle, and then that signals to the immune system to keep healthy,” says Dr. Jenna Macciochi, an immunologist based in Brighton, U.K. “Muscle building is so much more than just making you strong. It’s producing hormones and molecules that are involved in regulating many processes in the body.”Elaine Heighington, a 68-year-old retiree living in London with early stage osteoporosis, is hoping the Masters class will help quell her symptoms. Heighington was first introduced to CrossFit by her daughter over two years ago. A cheerful blonde in workout leggings, Heighington found that the combination of strength and cardio was enough variety to keep her interested. “I get bored easily,” she says.Heighington considers CrossFit her alternative to the medication her doctor initially suggested. “I did my own research and found a study that showed you can reverse osteoporosis by lifting,” says Heighington, who is watching her 92-year-old mother become increasingly frail due to the same condition. “I decided that before I take medication, I want to try this route.”Dr. Andrea Klemes, an endocrinologist and Chief Medical Officer at MDVIP, a network of primary care physicians across the United States, confirms that weight training has been shown to be helpful for building bone density in people with osteoporosis, due to the fact that putting stress on bones can spur bone-forming cells into action. “If you’re exercising, you may be able to help protect your body from a fracture if you do fall, because your muscles are stronger,” she says.Exercise can also help prevent other debilitating health conditions, like heart disease, by lowering heart attack risk factors like inflammation and cholesterol, as well as keeping blood sugar stable. Aerobic exercise may help alleviate depression, and it also boosts the size of the hippocampus, a part of the brain vital for memory and learning. All of this should be taken with the caveat that seniors and people with illnesses should always consult a doctor to ensure their workout plans are suitable.“I almost never prescribe medicine if I can get somebody to do the work,” says Dr. Jessalynn Adam, a sports medicine and rehabilitation specialist in Baltimore, Maryland who says she has patients who have been able to substantially improve their health through working out. “High cholesterol, diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, heart disease — there are fewer side effects with exercise.”Despite its benefits, only 23% of Americans get enough exercise, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Lee Steggles, the co-owner of CrossFit Shapesmiths, calls the location “a social club disguised as a gym,” which he says is Shapesmiths’ strategy for getting people hooked.The workout spaces are open to the street, and anyone who walks past can peer in and watch people lift heavy weights and flip tires. Steggles says if you look past the handstand crowd in the front, you’ll see there are plenty of people of all shapes, sizes, and ages. The youngest member of the gym is eight and the oldest is 84 — the seniors quota is small but growing.If people can remain motivated enough to keep up the routine — whether it be CrossFit or simply a daily walk — the payoff is worthwhile, even if they start when they’re older. Adam, the sports medicine doctor, says anyone can make a “pretty big impact” on all the main physiological changes of age — these being muscle loss, water loss, and cardiovascular capacity. “I don’t think there’s ever a point where it’s too late to start exercising,” she says.Richard Dean, another co-owner of CrossFit Shapesmiths, can speak to the “it’s never too late” ethos from a personal level. Dean says he used to have a very unhealthy lifestyle until his mid-40s: “I smoked 25 [cigarettes] a day, liked to drink, ate terribly, did no exercise.” A tall guy with a shaved head, Dean is now 51, not that you can tell. For him, managing to quit smoking was the trigger to embrace a healthier approach to other aspects of his life. “I have an addictive personality, so when I kicked the smoking habit I wondered, what else I can do? I’d broken the barrier of being able to defeat something.” Dean says he knows there will come a day when he won’t be able to keep lifting increasingly heavier weights. “But the human psyche is a strange thing,” he says. “You are what you think you are.”Adi, the Masters coach, says she works on helping people create a state of mind of resilience. “Being out of breath is a bubble of discomfort,” she says. “But [when you exercise regularly] you become comfortable being uncomfortable. It teaches you how to withstand discomfort and still function. That’s a huge thing.”After our workout together ended, Cox headed out to France to spend a few weeks at his vacation house. He was bringing along some weights so he can keep up with his strength training over the summer. “One of my aims this year is to do a pushup on the floor,” he said. A few weeks later Adi showed me a photo that Cox had sent her of him carrying a large plank of wood in his garden, with a caption that read “heavy lifting,” and thanked CrossFit. A push-up on the floor may be a milestone, but being able to lift and carry heavy things around in everyday life is what really matters.Written by"
31,Pump You Up: The Enduring Power of Protein Powder,"My friend David recently hopped on the protein-powder express. Everyone I know seems to be downing the stuff, but I never thought David would join them. He’s a world-class food photographer, a Brooklyn boulevardier, a brilliant cook. He’s also Mr. Natural. David shops at farmers’ markets, drinks biodynamic wine, eats with the seasons. He forages. But the last time I saw him, he confessed that Gold Standard whey protein is his new culinary bestie.Why? David was on a mission to get ripped, and that involved intense lifting every day, and that meant his body was chewing up calories like Quadzilla. If he was going to build serious muscle, his trainer told him, he needed to eat 200 grams of protein a day.That’s a ton of protein. The recommended daily amounts are 46 grams for women and 56 for men. In food terms, that equates to eating four large chicken breasts a day, which David actually did for a while, but he found it dull to spend that much time eating. More often than not, he’d reach the end of the day well short of his 200 grams — and a couple of scoops of Gold Standard 100% Whey (24g of protein per scoop), blitzed with bananas and berries, got him over the line.I’ve written about food for 20 years, and I stay on top of nutritional science. I’ve eaten semi-paleo for years and I’m pleased with the beefcake-lite results, but I’ve always relegated powdered protein to the realm of health scams. I favor writer Michael Pollan’s rule about not eating anything your grandmother wouldn’t recognize. (Then again, my grandmother made it through the 1960s and 1970s on little more than cigarettes and Bugles.)But it’s become obvious that protein powder is no longer a trend reserved for muscle boys. It’s a $30 billion industry. It’s being pounded by Instagram influencers, teenage athletes, and aspirational octogenarians. It beckons from coolers of ready-to-drink shakes in every Walmart, Costco, and Whole Foods. What is so appealing about consuming daily dollops of beige powder?Most obviously, it’s about getting fit, which is often really about not getting fat. And since Americans have been taught that high-fat or high-carb diets cause weight gain, that leaves protein as the only macro left to eat. And technically it works. Unquestionably, protein leads to general buffness in a way that carbs and fat do not. But taking that logic to the extreme gets messy. Eating highly processed powder that bears no resemblance to food (not even Bugles) has to be bad for you, right?Proteins are biology’s masterpieces — incredibly complex molecules that can do highly diverse tasks. In a sense, they are life: All the actions that living things take, from moving and thinking to digesting and detoxifying, are done with proteins.Consider your genes. You have about 21,000. Each one carries the genetic blueprint for making a single protein. Every moment, your cells are following the code in your genes and stringing together nutrients from your food supply to build new proteins. Amino acids are the Lego blocks from which proteins are made. There are 20 different amino acids and a typical protein is a twisting chain of thousands of them, coiling around itself, which gives it a unique shape, chemistry, and function. Some proteins form muscle fibers that contract, some snip food into pieces in your stomach, and some detect invaders.But ultimately, as my friend David tells me, the quest for fitness isn’t about living longer, it’s about living more intensely, being able to crush life like a banana cream shake.Every day, your body breaks apart the protein you eat into amino acids and sends those to your cells to be reconstructed into new proteins. There’s no way to store amino acids, so you need a new supply every day. For this reason, the body has a particular hunger for protein that can’t be satisfied with potato chips or cookies. Making sure meals contain protein can help control overeating. Because protein molecules are complex and hard to break down, they keep you satiated for longer and take more energy to digest. Compared to an equivalent amount of carbs or fat, protein will provide fewer excess calories to be stored as body fat.In the developed world, most people get more than enough protein to meet their modest fitness needs. The typical American woman consumes 70 grams of protein a day without really trying, while the typical man eats 102. But serious athletes and bodybuilders need about one gram of protein per pound of body weight. They can benefit from a big pipeline of protein in a convenient form — like a powder. This is not news to the gym community. In fact, they’ve been way ahead of the trend for decades.The first popularized protein powder was created by a man named Irvin Johnson, who ran a gym in Chicago. In 1950, he published an article in Iron Man, one of the leading musclehead magazines of the era, titled “Build Bigger Biceps Faster with Food Supplements.” This flew in the face of the weightlifting wisdom of the day, which held that a normal, balanced diet provided all the nutrients necessary for a well-sculpted body.Over several articles in the next year, Johnson made his case for protein supplementation in Iron Man. “Are you interested in building bulging muscles, muscles with superb muscular tone, muscles rippling with strength?” he wrote. “Of course you are or you wouldn’t be reading this magazine. Let me pass on to you one of the great secrets I learned sometime ago about muscle building, one that has proven so very successful in my work here at the Irvin Johnson Gymnasium.”Johnson goes on to accurately explain why protein is the only macronutrient that can build new muscle. His understanding of physiology was well ahead of his time, yet he was also a classic huckster. “Here at the Irvin Johnson Gym,” he wrote, “where records in muscle building are being made at all times… we are always experimenting with foods and supplements to find out which are the best to include in the muscle building diet. We have made up our own food, which is called, ‘Irvin Johnson’s Hi-Protein Food’. We have been using this new food for several months and the results have been wonderful.”Some of the miraculous transformations described in the magazine defy belief. One young man reportedly arrived at Johnson’s gym weighing 169 pounds with 14.5-inch biceps. After a single day on Johnson’s formula, he jumped to 181 pounds with a 16.75-inch bicep. All according to Johnson.Johnson Hi-Protein Food, which was soy-based, cost $4 for a four-pound bag, and buyers could choose from plain, vanilla, chocolate, coconut, or, inexplicably, black walnut. Johnson sold his powder exclusively through the York Barbell Company, whose founder, Bob Hoffman, was the godfather of midcentury American fitness. Hoffman published Strength & Health, the top fitness magazine of the time, and he was the coach of the American Olympic weightlifting team from 1936 to 1968.In 1952, Strength & Health suddenly stopped advertising Johnson’s Hi-Protein Food and switched to Hoffman’s Special Hi-Proteen — available in plain, vanilla, chocolate, coconut, or black walnut. From then on, the York Barbell Company filled all orders with Hoffman’s powder, and Johnson was left in limbo. Hoffman’s Special Hi-Proteen had mixed success — it was notorious for the gas it produced in its enthusiasts — but Hoffman continued to introduce new nutritional supplements, accompanied by flamboyant testimonials, and he made a fortune (despite having dozens of products seized by the FDA for misleading health claims).Johnson, meanwhile, wasn’t done. After laying low for a while, he changed his name to Rheo H. Blair and reemerged in Los Angeles in the 1960s as a nutrition guru to the stars, working with such he-men as Charlton Heston and Lawrence Welk. His recipe transformed, too. Instead of soy, Blair’s Instant Protein was based on dried milk and eggs, making it the forerunner of today’s formulations.Do not underestimate how gross those early protein powders must have been. They were dried using heat, rollers, and other equipment that oxidized them. No one knew how to make the powders soluble, so they were gritty and bitter. That began to change in the 1970s and 1980s with the introduction of sophisticated membranes that could separate most solids from a liquid at room temperature. Today, using ultrafiltration membranes, spray-drying, and other technologies, it’s possible to concentrate proteins into soluble powders while preserving their integrity.The options for cheap sources of protein have been, and remain, eggs, milk, and soy (with peas and hemp seed recently joining the pack). If you’re vegan, soy, pea, or hemp are your main options, and they all work just fine. (Ignore what you hear about incomplete proteins that lack certain amino acids; if you are eating a variety of foods, you aren’t going to have any amino deficiencies.)Today the most popular source of protein supplement is whey, the byproduct of cheese making. To make cheese, milk is separated into solids (curds) and liquid (whey). The curds get turned into cheese, but for every one pound of cheese, there are nine pounds of whey to deal with. Today, many cheese operations could more accurately be described as whey-protein businesses with a little cheese making on the side. The top brand of whey protein, Gold Standard, was bought in 2008 by Glanbia, a giant Irish cheese maker looking to solve its whey problem.If the goal is to get semi-ripped, then whey powder can be a godsend for all the reasons it appealed to my friend David. It’s the easiest, cheapest way to add a lot of protein without too many carbs and fat, and the amino acids in whey are exactly what your muscles are looking for.But are any of these powders (soy, pea, hemp, or whey) healthy?Lots of folks have tried to pin health scares on protein powder, with limited success. High-protein diets have been accused of being hard on the kidneys, which have to process all those aminos, though this doesn’t seem to be a problem for people with healthy kidneys. A bigger concern is that people who pound protein might not get enough other micronutrients, which are mostly found in carb-rich fruits and vegetables.But the biggest issue with protein powders is what else might be in them. Like all dietary supplements, they receive no governmental safety testing. It’s up to the companies to conduct their own testing, and based on what third parties have found, some aren’t doing a very good job. Heavy-metal contamination is commonplace. In 2018, the Clean Label Project analyzed 134 of the top protein powder products. Seventy percent tested positive for lead, 74% for cadmium, and 55% for BPA, a known carcinogen and hormone disruptor. Worth noting: Organic products had twice the heavy metals (but lower levels of BPA) compared to nonorganic, and plant-based products were the most contaminated, while egg-based products were the least. Some products (Puori vanilla, Biochem vanilla, Body Fortress vanilla) tested low for all metals, but there wasn’t much consistency among the products of a particular brand.There are other concerns, too. Some researchers have found links between high-protein diets and diabetes or heart disease, though more research is needed. High-protein intake also stimulates cell proliferation, which is great if you’re trying to make more muscle cells, but not so great if you’re trying to prevent cancer or cell aging. Serious bodybuilders have a disturbing habit of dying young. High-protein eaters may burn twice as bright, but half as long.But ultimately, as my friend David tells me, the quest for fitness isn’t about living longer, it’s about living more intensely, being able to crush life like a banana cream shake. I thought about that this morning as I stared at a scoop of protein powder on my kitchen counter. It was biology’s masterpiece, sitting there in a kind of suspended animation. How could I resist the opportunity to raise it from the dead, to transform it into even more living, breathing, flexing, pumping me?Written by"
32,Paper Planes,"It all started with a simple, whimsical idea.Paper planes and high places.“Adam, are you doing anything this afternoon?”“Well, I’m at the office right now,” he said.“Do you still work at that big building in Akasaka?”“Uh, yeah. Why?”“You think we could get to the roof? Sneak out for an hour?”He considered it.“Yes,” he said. “I think we could do that.”I bought some A4 paper from a local stationery shop. A calming emerald green. Just beautiful. I hefted it to Adam’s office building in Akasaka.He met me at reception.“Delivery,” he said.The receptionist nodded and gave me a visitor’s pass. We jumped in an elevator.I looked out at the buildings and the traffic.“You think there’s a girl out there for me?” I asked.“Out where?”“You know, out there.”I took my time. Folding. Creasing. Getting it just right.“Maybe. Probably. Statistically? Definitely.”“Hm.”Adam let a plane go. Watched it a moment. Smiled.“Man, this feels good,” he said. “We should do this more often.”So we did.We wandered the city. Listed potential spots. Drew maps.We wore suits at some places. Looked like deliverymen at others. Turns out if you look like you’re supposed to be there, and ask for Suzuki — there’s always one — reception will usually let you straight up.We threw planes from office buildings. Apartment blocks. Old factories. University libraries. Each offered something unique to its location.Most of the big buildings — the dream spots — we couldn’t get into. Mori Tower, Toranomon Hills, the Metropolitan Government Building. Tokyo Tower. Security was tight. It seemed impossible.We still tried.Some days we set off fire alarms.“I mean, you would think there is someone out there, right? For me, I mean.”“Statistically, yes.”Adam watched another plane fly from his hand. Nodded.“You and those statistics.”“Well, it helps put things in perspective, you know? It’s how I make sense of the world.”“What are you writing?”The paper said: Let’s be lonely together.And underneath that, a phone number.“Wait,” I said. “Is that my phone number?”“It’s an experiment.”“What?”“Like, a statistics experiment.”He folded the paper and threw the plane. We watched it float, and dive, and spin through the air.“That’s thirty,” he said. “So I guess now we just see what happens.”I groaned. Adam laughed.And then we went home.At first, there was nothing.Then one day, a phone call.It was a salaryman. Kohei. He said the paper was stuck in his bicycle. He liked the color of it. So calming.He said he didn’t know why he called.“Let’s talk,” I said.Kohei talked about his life. About working for a small game development company, playing pachinko, reading shojo manga. He said he missed his wife and kids. Said they were long gone now. Weren’t coming back.I asked how old they were. What he thought they might be doing. What it was like having kids. I asked about his favorite characters in his favorite manga. Where the appeal was in pachinko. How to play.He talked, and he talked, and eventually, he stopped.He said he felt much better.Funnily enough, so did I.“So yesterday I went to Glitch, finally,” I said. “You were right. The coffee is good. Excellent.”“Yeah, wait. What’s with the paper?”“What do you mean?”I took a piece, folded it, and stared at the city before me. Where to throw first?“I mean, what’s with the times? ‘Unavailable from 8:00 to 13:00’?”I’d scribbled it underneath my phone number.“Well, I have to work, you know? If I can’t work, I can’t eat. I need some space between the phone calls to actually get work done, yeah?”I waited for it. That point where the wind felt just right. A little lift, a little push. I let the paper plane go, and watched it twist and turn above the buildings. How lazy. How free. The first one was always my favorite.“Wait,” Adam said. “You mean people are actually calling you?”All sorts of people called.Stressed office workers, students on break, bored housewives, part-timers in search of dreams — they were all lonely, and we shared that. Gave it warmth. Made it ours. They spoke, and I listened. An unspoken agreement. Comfortable. Calming.Some six or seven people called in the afternoon. In the evening, four or five. After that, I turned the phone off.And then I met Yuki.“I found your flyer,” she said.“Thanks for calling.”“I like the color. So calming.”“It’s wonderful, isn’t it?”“I’m Yuki.”“Hello, Yuki.”“Can we talk?”“We can.”“Does it take long?”“Uh, sometimes? It depends on the person.”“So what do we talk about?”“Well, whatever you want, really. What do you feel like talking about, Yuki?”Yuki was the first person to do something no one else had.She was the first to ask me about me.“The police called?”I nodded.“Yeah, they wanted to know about the papers,” I said.“What did you say?”“I said I didn’t know. I said it was the first I’d heard about it.”“Did they believe you?”“No. They said if it was me, I should at least make the paper biodegradable. It wouldn’t be a cleanup issue that way.”“And you said?”“I said as soon as I could source good, quality biodegradable paper that flew well and looked nice, I’d do it.”Adam laughed.“Busted.”I smiled. Shrugged. We threw another two planes from the roof.“Doesn’t matter,” I said. “That officer sometimes calls on Thursday nights when work slows down. Tetsu is his name. Good guy. Diligent, kind. He was just offering advice.”Yuki called once a week. Every Tuesday, 19:30. She asked about my day, my writing, my calls. I shared funny stories from work, and ideas I had floating around in my head.I could hear her smile through the phone. Repressed excitement in her voice. She chased my ideas like a puppy with a tennis ball — unsure exactly what to do with them but enraptured all the same.And little by little, she opened up. She had a pet cat, Mr. Mittens. Lived in a tiny apartment along the Inokashira Line. Worked a boring customer service job. Liked to draw. Loved it. Sketched a picture a day. Mostly of people. Sometimes Mr. Mittens. Sometimes a landscape.I asked her to show me some. She said she couldn’t. Had never. Could never. I said she should. I said please.No no no, she said, giggling.It was something like flirting.And in the flirting and the talking, was something like friendship. Something like romance.Perhaps something like love.Adam looked up from his half-folded plane.“A TV station called? Seriously?”“Yeah, a morning program,” I said. “I forget the name. They wanted an interview. I said we could talk on the phone, but they wanted in-person.”“You won’t do in-person?”I shook my head.“I think it would spoil what I have with the people I talk to.”I had this idea that on the phone, I was malleable. Without shape. Each caller imagined me a particular way — a way that made them comfortable. To see me in person, I thought, would cause a clash of reality and imagination.In that clash, reality always wins. I didn’t want it to.“But TV, man,” Adam said.“Yeah, I know.”“You don’t ever want to meet them? The people you talk to?”“I don’t know that they ever want to meet me, if I’m honest. I’m quite happy with things as they are. There’s a simple status quo, and I don’t feel lonely.”“Fair enough.”We threw some more planes. Made jokes about Bob Ross. Impersonations as they pertained to plane throwing. Laughed. We talked video games and design, and I thought about the loneliness I felt. The way it was changing over time.A gradual slide, like blue to green, from loneliness to longing.And I wondered which I preferred.“They asked you on TV?”“Yeah,” I said. “Can you believe it?”There was a moment of silence. Deep thoughts swam in it.“Yes,” Yuki said simply.I laughed.“What? You seem like a nice guy. Maybe people want to know you.”“I listen to people talk. If it helps, great. I’m happy. But I don’t need to go on TV. If I do, or if I meet people, I’ll spoil the illusion.”“There’s an illusion?”“Well, no. Probably not. It’s just me.”“You’re the illusion?”“No, I’m the spoiler.”She laughed.“You won’t meet anyone?” she asked.“Not if I can help it.”“Never?”“Well, never say never, right?”“Would you ever meet me?”I paused for a moment.“I… would that be okay?”“Is it okay with you?”“It’s okay with me if it’s okay with you.”“It’s okay with me.”“And me, too.”We shared the silence. A space that felt like it was closing in.“Should we just… should we meet, then?” she asked.Teenagers, all over again.“Would you… would you bring one of your pictures?”I sat at the cafe. Waited.I waited for an hour. Then two.I waited for a long time.Inside, couples, families, and friends sat and talked. The air buzzed with conversation. Laughter. Joy. Staff members prepared coffee. Poured it with a smile.Outside, traffic rolled by. Cars. Motorbikes. Scooters.Pedestrians.Any one of them could have been her. Any one of them could have been Yuki.But none of them was.I didn’t hear from her that week.Life went on. The world kept spinning.People called, and we talked, and there was a feeling like relief and fleeting joy.Yuki didn’t call the next week, either. Or the next.It was something like a gradual slide, like green to blue, from longing back to loneliness.I didn’t need to wonder which one I preferred.I knew.“So you’re plane throwing without me now?”“What?”Adam passed over a piece of paper.“This,” he said. “Is this you?”It was a cat. A pencil sketch of a tabby, sitting on the edge of a desk. Pens sprawled across its surface. Sunlight streaming in from an open window.The paper was creased. I knew those folds.It was a plane, once.“This isn’t me,” I said.“Yeah, I thought so. I didn’t think you could draw.”I nodded.“Guess you’ve got yourself a copycat,” Adam said.“I guess so.”I stared at that cat for a long time. Listened to Adam whistle while he worked.“It’s nice to meet you, Mr. Mittens,” I said.“What?”I shook my head.“It’s nothing,” I said. “Where did you find this, anyway?”The next day I walked from Shibuya Station, toward Roppongi. I dropped in and out of back streets, picking up paper planes. Unfolding them, staring at the pictures, and putting them in my bag.Each of them contained a sketch — a landscape, a cat, a girl staring out the window, a boy drinking a coffee.I took them home, and I put them in a folder.And I stared at those pictures for a long time.Each Wednesday I found a new picture or two somewhere in Aoyama.I had enough to categorize my folders.Cats. People. Nature. Birds.And finally, a cityscape as drawn from upon high.I knew those buildings. Knew that space. Knew that sky.It was one of the dream spots. It was in Shibuya.“I need to get to the top of the Mixi building,” I said.“We tried that already. They kicked us out, remember?”“Yeah, but I have a hunch about something.”“A hunch about what?”“I can’t say.”“You can’t say.”I shook my head.“I can’t say.”I felt like she wanted me to find her.I just couldn’t say it.“Alright,” Adam said. He sighed. Nodded. “I’ll order a package delivery to an upper floor. It won’t be their’s so they’ll need someone to pick it up and return it. That’s your way in. You’ll have to look the part, and you won’t have much time, but that’s probably the best I can do.”“It has to be Tuesday,” I said.“What? Why?”I stared at him. Shook my head.“Okay, okay,” he said. “I get it. You can’t say.”We watched the skyline a moment longer.“Thanks,” I said.On Tuesday night, reception was empty.I looked around the empty foyer of the Mixi building. Outside at the traffic passing by in the night. Shrugged.I took the escalator to the second floor and an elevator to the roof.“How did you get up here?” Yuki asked.I shrugged.“It’s odd,” I said. “There’s uh… there’s no one at the reception desk. You?”She smiled. Blushed.“I’m the receptionist.”We stood there for a moment. She with a piece of paper in hand, me with my hands in my pockets.She looked like her voice — delicate, beautiful, and wrapped in timidity.“Your art,” I said, “I really like it.”“You always said I should share it.”“I’m glad you have.”She blushed again.“Bit cheeky, isn’t it?”I smiled. “I think it’s a great idea. But one thing, if I may?”“Oh?”“Will you let me teach you how to fold a sturdy paper plane?”We threw planes in silence for a time. Watched them twirl, dance, dive, and float.“This is nice,” she said.“It is,” I said. “It is.”“I… I didn’t think it would be.”“What did you think it would be?”“I don’t know. Something different. Something… bad.” She paused. “Something disappointing.”“Hm.”“Look,” she said, “I’m… I’m sorry I never called.”“You don’t have to be sorry,” I said. “It was never something to be sorry for.”“But…”I shook my head.“Let’s just throw some paper planes, yeah?”“Will you keep doing it?”“Hm?”“Answering calls,” Yuki said, “Talking to strangers about their lives.”I thought about it. Looked down at the plane I was folding.“I figure as long as people keep calling, I’ll keep listening,” I said. “It’s just… I don’t know. I feel like in this city, we’re all porcupines that can’t hug because we’re too scared of hurting each other. These calls are like long-distance hugs, I think. There’s space, but there’s warmth. It’s a unique kind of connection. A link between lost souls.”“Long-distance hugs,” she said. “I like that.”We stood in silence. Listened to the wind through the air and the traffic below. Life as it crept around corners.“I’m a porcupine, too,” she said finally.“Okay.”“Even long-distance hugs are hard for me.”I nodded.“And that’s okay, too.”And a gentle lightness in the air. Serenity.A smile.“Thank you.”Yuki watched a plane float through the sky. Looked at her watch.“Can we do this some more?” she asked. “Can we do this for a bit longer?”“As long as you like,” I said.It was a relationship like a paper plane in flight.Lost and aimless, rambling and free. We didn’t know where it might go, or where it might land — we were happy just to see it float, and fly, and ride on the wind.We were making a different kind of hug altogether.One for just the two of us.MusicWritten by"
33,"Meditations On Sucking At Relationships, Dating, And Not-Dating, Too, As It Happens","I have a date tonight is a thing I didn’t say much last calendar year, though at the time of this writing — a Thursday, one of the last of 2017— it happens to be true. Or it’s true for the time being (3:26 p.m. being the time being), which doesn’t necessarily mean it will be true later (later being tonight). I have a five-hour window during which some blessed derailment could occur: an apartment emergency or a sudden deadline or perhaps a seasonal stomach flu which, as it happens, never really go out of season.I used to be more comfortable making dates and then making stories as to why I could no longer make the dates, but now I try to avoid it. I made very few excuses in 2017, and even fewer commitments — which, it should be obvious, was key to my making fewer excuses. It turns out I didn’t need as many once I realized it was okay, perhaps even healthy, to experience a period of time in which my romantic/sexual desires do not inform my every thought and action. So much of my adult life has been colored by a relationship or shaded by the absence of one; always falling in love or growing into it, then falling or crashing out of it, and then a period of mourning, followed by a period of rebirth, Spiritual Spring, femininity more potent than at any time in human history, all dead things jerking back to life now — me included and especially.Usually at that point in the cycle I’d enter a new relationship that was aesthetically different from the last but functionally, not so much. All lessons learned forgotten, if I like how you smell in the morning. Does it not always come down to that? I can buy you a book, Google you a therapist, measure your inseam and talk to the shop girl on your behalf but I can’t create your pheromones in my own image. Some things can be fixed, improved, overlooked, managed; but others — the invisible and magical things over which I have no control, the wild things — those are the things that choose me, not the other way around. Maybe this is why I don’t trust my instincts when it comes to dating apps: I know what I’m supposed to look for, what a healthy version of myself would want and accept. And then dude shows up for the date smelling all wrong. What’s a feral bitch to do?I have a couple common afflictions, one of them being codependency. Perhaps you’ve heard of it. It’s a type of dysfunctional relationship in which one or both (or all) participants are addicted: addicted to substances, addicted to helping, addicted to each other. A mother who drives her alcoholic son to the liquor store at 9 a.m. because he’s too smashed to get behind the wheel is codependent. Though she might know her actions will eventually kill her son, the alternative — losing his love and attention in the short term — is a worse fate. But while codependency was first identified and observed amongst the families and friends of alcoholics, sobriety does not equal immunity: One can also be addicted to love! sex! pretty much anything! And since codependency can take on many forms, it can be hard to recognize — especially when you’re one of its hostages, especially when most or all of your romantic relationships have been codependent to the extent that the bliss of being needed, or the bliss of being accommodated, is what signals (to you) that this is *for real*. Meanwhile, healthy relationships — those with boundaries, and clear communication, and accountability — seem cold, boring in comparison. Too much work! Not enough need! Where is the passion!If you are the type of person who needs to be needed — or the type of person who needs to enabled — you may be prone to codependent relationships. I was (am?), and so last summer I told my therapist that I was taking a break from dating while I learned to derive satisfaction from something other than making specific men believe that I am Good and Useful. She told me I could date and learn to do that at the same time. I told her that, in addition to being sure I would swaddle my independence and dump it on some church steps the second I felt a feeling again, the idea of dating exhausted me. Then she hit me with, “I’d be exhausted too, if I never felt safe enough to ask for what I wanted.”“It’s not like that,” I told her, unsure whether we were addressing a specific instance or a general pattern.She asked who takes care of me, then, which I won’t put into dialogue because I didn’t have a response. I wanted to say, “I take care of me,” but I don’t. Other people’s needs are more urgent, more interesting. Always have been.She continued, in the Here’s a concept sort of way that precedes all considered monologues, “What if your next partner took care of himself, and you took care of yourself, and with all of that out of the way, you’d both have more time to enjoy the relationship?”Honestly sounded like alien-talk to me. I paused to consider the couples in my life: Did people do this, come to the table whole? Had I witnessed this before without realizing it? And what would me and my Whole Boyfriend do with all that extra time in which we’re not feeding each other’s soul holes? Go on a cruise? Because truth told, given my birth rank in the American caste system, and my affinity for middling live entertainment and shrimp towers, and the way it feels to search for solid earth with my eyes and not find it, no land or escape for miles — knots? — what I’m trying to say is, if someone were going to love me, they would have to be the type of person who can appreciate the type of person who appreciates a cruise. Or the concept of one, at least.But when I’m discussing my wants with the therapist, I don’t mention cruises. I don’t mention that, when I imagine the person I want to spend a significant amount of my future time with, all I’ve sketched of the character so far is Fun At Weddings. I don’t explain that Fun At Weddings is code for: unashamed to be seen with me in emotional and formal settings; lets small children stand on the tops of his feet while he dances their fawn-like bodies around the room the way my dad used to with me; tolerates my own “Fun” Wedding Behavior, such as leading the reception in a medium-accurate rendition of the Grammy award-winning music video “Thriller” — just one of my many good-natured quirks that will become less endearing and more predictable throughout the years, perhaps unbearably so, though close friends have endured my “Fun” Wedding Behavior — and graver offenses — for decades so it’s not out of the realm of possibility; unafraid to make eye contact with 80-year-old women, dance with 80-year-old-women, tease 80-year-old women. Eighty years is just a placeholder for however long I end up living. Finally — and this is not required but is smiled upon — Giving Good Speech. Public speaking terrifies me and so whatever it is inside of someone that allows them to do it, and charmingly so… I don’t understand it, which means it falls under the umbrella of invisible and magical things — and you know how I feel about those.I don’t get into details with my therapist because. Because I’m not ready to translate these specific and condition-contingent wants into action items. Because I’m not clearheaded enough, at current, to discern between compromising and settling. Because knowing what I want also means knowing what I don’t want, except sometimes what I want and what I don’t want are the same thing; manufactured in the same factory, and isn’t cross-contamination a bitch? Because my wants are, and always have been, transient, rooted in how a person makes me feel or how I feel about a person but not in the person himself, which means the dissatisfaction of one or both parties is imminent. And of course, he’ll leave first — physically, emotionally, it depends on which narrative makes most sense — at which time I can point out that I was right to hold back, that I was aware of this destiny all along but allowed idealistic others to convince me different, and look what happened, I underline “again,” so of course none of this has to do with me and my shortcomings as a partner or as a person in general. Because if it did, I would have to do something about it. And.When it comes to love, is there a difference between wants and needs? Isn’t it all a want of some sort, given that you live without these so-called needs met when you’re single, or when you might as well be? Then again, I suppose those in functioning relationships upgrade their wants to needs—needs like respect and honesty and communication, which are not needs in the strict sense of the word but more like standards, boundaries, things I have struggled to define or even require — because “I can do bad all by myself,” to quote Tyler Perry for some reason.I would say that I consider most things that do not keep me alive “wants,” but that might suggest I consider them at all. For most of my life, defining my wants and needs fell out of my purview — it wasn’t an intentional thing, I just didn’t take the time to decide and so someone else always did. I’m like that person who can’t figure out where to eat lunch. Just like that.I learned at a young age that wanting things was a good way to get disappointed. Growing up, my mom was always quick to inform me that the thing I thought I needed was actually just a want, and an ill-formed one at that, because she had been around longer than I had, seen how these fads came and went. And also, someday I would realize this, but the things I thought I wanted? Too ugly to stand the test of time, which is why a fake and/or cheap version will suffice, and why did I want to turn myself into a walking billboard for Tommy Hilfiger, anyway? What did he ever do for me? And if Monica jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge wearing those powder blue patent leather Reeboks with the double Velcro straps…? WELL?So wanting never quite worked in my favor. I never went without the things I “needed,” school books, clean underwear (they might not have been the notebooks or underwear I’d have chosen for myself, but what are you gonna do). Needs were outlined and provided by adults: parent, teacher, politician. Wants were different: they were renting a VHS for the weekend or eating McDonald’s for dinner: fringe benefits, by no means expected or required to live.And so meeting, and falling in love, and sharing a life with another person is a) a want so large and difficult to fulfill — approximately 1000 times more difficult than getting McDonald’s for dinner — that subconsciously I’m not sure why I would win that particular lotto and b) enticing but ultimately unnecessary. Just to be logical about it. The promise of lifelong commitment is not something I need, clearly, because I don’t have it right now and here I am all alive, typing thousands and thousands of words about how much I don’t need this one particular thing that lots of other people have acquired, sort of effortlessly, or at least it seems so from here.One thing about me is the stuff I don’t need is the stuff I want most.Maybe all this bluster is meant to distract me, and you, from the fact that I still don’t know what I want or need from another person. I never took the time to tease that out because, plainly, I didn’t feel like being disappointed. Don’t want no shit, won’t get no shit. And that’s just fine! I still don’t have a driver’s license because I couldn’t afford a car when I turned sixteen; this doesn’t explain why I don’t drive now, fifteen years later, but it does illustrate how if you tell yourself you don’t need something enough times, it will eventually come to pass that you’re right.Terrifying.Most men I’ve dated knew — or thought they knew — what they needed, which was usually Not Me. The specifics were harder to articulate beyond that; they just knew something was amiss. And perhaps it was that confidence — that knowing of needs, even when used as a weapon against me — that I was attracted to. A confidence I both lack and admire, the irony, but as they say: opposites attract. Until they don’t. It’s not anyone’s fault. I mean, half these guys didn’t even know who they were dating, because I didn’t tell them. And you can’t expect people to need someone they don’t know exists; you can’t expect them to know you, when you don’t even know you. The ephemeral and conditional version of you — the one you offer up to protect the real and messy version of you — it might be agreeable, it might scratch a short-term itch, but is it Wifey? Because as it happens, you don’t have to be agreeable, or any nice and simple thing, to find love. In fact, I’m starting to believe all you need to be is convincing.I do not have a good record of convincing. I’ve always had a lot of feelings, currents of emotional energy, a hunger for physical touch, Gasoline as Blood; I’ve always needed a place to put these things. I needed a place more than I needed to be known, to be heard (it seemed that way, at least) and so in relationships I worked toward a desired outcome — to keep happy the person, who was also the place, (my receptacle), so that I might keep both — though my behavior was often in conflict with how I felt. That is, if I remembered I had feelings of my own — most times I skipped that part of the integration, which means many of my decisions, the things I said and even thought, did not reflect what I felt; rather I was guessing at what was “right.” And of course by “right” I mean, “what is the thing I can say that will make him love me like, for real.” I wanted to be loved for real because then, maybe (and yes, ironically, again), I would feel safe enough to be myself. Do you follow? I thought the only way to be myself was to first be someone else, as though one version of myself was simply a gateway drug to the truer, more accurate version.I confess: It’s a flawed strategy. One of the worst I’ve conceived. Because I had never, would never say, or do, the “right” thing in a relationship: the “right” thing is convincing, it has conviction. It has a point of view, and a point of origin; it has a point. Each time I remembered this — usually during some breakup negotiation, when it dawned on me that I had nothing to lose and could say whatever I wanted and it was going to feel so fucking good, finally — I was rewarded. I had expected that sharing my Real Feels would result in accusations of betrayal, or an equally shocking admission to punish me for my unapologetic cowardice and hypocrisy, which had no doubt quietly tainted the relationship — but instead I got dismay. Shock, in some cases. And active, unsolicited attention, which is — mind you, it’s been some years now so this is just a guess — probably all I wanted in the first place.You can see why these relationships — inadvertently made one-sided by both my eagerness to please and my misguided assumptions that pleasing required I remain unknown — failed to evolve.I’ve experienced most breakup configurations, dumped and been dumped and then there was one I *think* we both classify as mutual, though I took it harder and could have contorted my emotions a dozen-or-so more times before the thing ended for-real for real. Only once did I want and initiate a breakup — and while it was hand-to-god exhilarating, to be the one for whom singledom was inviting and not in any way a reflection of my own personal failings, I’m usually the other one. (In fact, even the guy I dumped had dumped me first, and second.) So the ends of things began to play out with a familiar cadence that would evoke in me all the classics: insecurity and foolishness, dumb-assery. I often felt used. But then what had I done, given my partners only what I believed they wanted while omitting the rest so that I might enjoy the trappings of intimacy without actually engaging in it? If he doesn’t know about the rest, I must have reasoned, he can only reject what I’ve decided to show him. So when he leaves, it won’t be a rejection of everything I am. Just some of it.Perhaps I’ve been used, but perhaps I’ve been a user. You know? Maybe I’m drawn to cursed relationships because when it comes down to it, I don’t want to feel safe yet. Because despite fancying myself a victim in the aftermath of a breakup, I’m not as safe as I purport to be. Because I’m not ready to be my whole self, or to be loved for it, or to work through the related implications, like: how do I cultivate enough trust in others, or enough confidence in myself, or enough whatever in whatever! to just… go about being who I am? How do I listen to my gut after allowing my brain to shout it down for so long? And knowing all of this — the deficiencies both listed and alluded to here, but also the others that are out of scope for this particular reflection — how can I waste even an hour of someone’s time knowing this is where I live?Sometimes a friend will share a problem with me and I’ll immediately want to advise them, provide them with options and comfort and empathy, but definitely sometimes just because it feels good, to not have that particular problem at that particular time. It also feels good to have figured out something that someone else hasn’t, of course, and sometimes you don’t realize you know a thing until someone else admits that they don’t — a realization that can become a little distracting, particularly if you haven’t had a win in a while. Possibly, you think, declaring the realization will allow you to recenter your friend’s problem, offer them a new angle to mull over, and what’s the harm? Or maybe you don’t think at all; maybe the advice is halfway out of your mouth before you realize it’s happening. Again.I had to be advised multiple times under these conditions before I realized I should aim to withhold advice until someone has asked for it. Sometimes people just want to vent. Sometimes they already know what they’re doing wrong, or what they’d like to change, and they’re just attempting to articulate the problem so that they can more clearly see the solution, but now they’re kinda sidetracked because they’re considering how your hypothetical advice may or may not figure into the actual experience they’re having, the original problem having officially been backburnered at this point, which. And it’s okay — I’m spelling this out precisely because my efforts to express empathy often manifest in me asserting authority over a situation I have not experienced, and I know most times advising someone who hasn’t asked to be is more a misguided gesture of goodwill than anything else. No judgments there.But it’s with this understanding — of the impulse to fix, advise — that I ask you to not, in this instance. Politely, I swear. Believe in intentional disclosure, particularly as I already have a track record of omitting things. Believe that for all the information you have from reading this far down, there is more, always more; there will be more in between the time I write these words and the time I publish them, and more after that. Believe that I have considered the following: that this particular piece of writing does little to make me appear more stable, generous, loving, confident, gracious, considerate, modest, kind, any number of qualities that might swing the balances in my favor; that I’m probably a nightmare to date; that I expect too much and too specifically; that I’m too old to be this confused; that given what I have on offer I can’t afford to be this old AND this confused; that this entire work is really just the mother of all sabotage and I am publishing it, consciously or not, as part of a self-fulfilling prophecy; that I get off on dissatisfaction; that I could find someone if I were less or more meh meh meh. You wouldn’t be wrong to accuse me of one, or all, or more of these things, but you would be wrong to think you are more of an authority on the ways in which I am wrong than I am.Though it is possible I’m so wrong, about everything, that I’m assuming some version of this screed is stashed in the heads of other terminally singles when it’s actually not. I suppose some of this disclosure is meant to test that theory — that I’m not the only one who thinks this way, that thinking this way doesn’t make me impossible to be with — it’s meant to reassure myself that I too can find love, even by being my overthinking and occasionally overwrought self, even with a brain intent on destroying anything resembling it. But if it so happens that I’m the only person on earth who is simultaneously a) aware that they are sabotaging themselves but b) in no rush to do anything practical about it, well. I think we can all agree that if this were the case, I would have far less time to wonder whether my hypothetical partner will treat cruises and weddings with the proper reverence. Which might not be a bad thing.But I digress. All I mean is that I both empathize with the desire to advise me and assert that there are too many details missing here — and from much of my writing, and even from my interactions with the people who know me best —to offer useful insight. If you’re very perceptive, you’ll note that what I’m doing here is creating a boundary, which we’ve earlier established is something I need to be proactive about, and maybe that’s enough to suggest to you, would-be advice-giver, that I am aware of some steps I could take to improve my situation — and occasionally, I’m even employing them.One last thing: I did not cancel the date I mentioned when I began writing this, two weeks ago. It was fine! It was a date. I call back to it now only because I loaded that particular gun, though I guess Chekhov would suggest a more explosive conclusion — it’s not much of a payoff. But sometimes people just want to vent! There’s a concept.Written by"
34,I Loved My Husband. I Loved Him So Much.,"People have all sorts of hidden talents; I am magic with a chicken. Golden brown, garlic-blistered, hissing herb-scented steam when you slice into it after 20 minutes of being driven mad by the smell. Waiting is the hardest part of the process, but like every worthwhile sensual pleasure, a great dinner responds gorgeously to delayed gratification.Chickens, like people, need time to rest after getting cooked.After work on Tuesdays, I would strip off my slim black pantsuit and slip into yoga pants and one of D’s sweatshirts. I’d mix fresh herbs with salt and olive oil, then massage the mixture underneath the skin of a small bird.Tuesdays were the only nights I had the apartment to myself — he taught an acting class from 7 to 10, his entire week whittled down to three hours of work.D had turned his back on quotidian concerns like paying rent, consumed by a feverish belief in the immediate inevitability of a big-time career. Hollywood producers beckoned from seaside patios in Malibu; Broadway people made offers no reasonable playwright could refuse. Those phone calls were not hallucinations. I heard them. I was taken along to steak dinners, bore witness to promises made, dreams hatched, famous names dropped like a breadcrumb trail out of obscurity.Everything was about to explode, so in the name of stability, I put my own creative work on hold and got a corporate job.One night around 11, a producer called and told him the deal was off. They were moving forward, of course, just without him. She made him promise not to kill himself, or her. Suddenly Tuesday night scene study was all he had left.“I love my husband. I love my husband so much.”I would catch myself chanting this as I trotted home to the top-floor apartment we never should have tried to afford. It was true, but since when does anything real bear so much repeating?This was a rough patch we’d tell our children about one day, when they were old enough to have torturous relationships of their own.Every night, I’d find him in his office chair in a cloud of smoke, heater on full blast. He’d be semi-catatonic, ruminating over his computer, or weeping hopelessly, or shouting about the crumbs I’d left in the sink before I’d gone to work.“Do it again, and I’ll leave you.”The year before, when his career possibilities reached their apex, D began serving up ultimatums about the clothing I wore (not revealing enough), the volume of my voice (too soft), the speed at which I walked (too slow or too fast, depending on the day). I had to solemnly swear to laugh at all his jokes, whether or not I found them funny. Because — and his therapist agreed on this — my refusal to laugh was evidence of a power struggle. The same shrink suggested he keep a running list of everything I did wrong. “If you saw it,” he warned, “you’d die.”But this was temporary. I loved my husband. I loved him so much. Marriage is no cakewalk: Anyone will tell you that. This was a rough patch we’d tell our children about one day, when they were old enough to have torturous relationships of their own.Later, D came to believe he’d gained psychic powers. He’d say a word and within seconds, someone would repeat it on television. He started having prophetic dreams, which he’d verify via Google. One night I had to beg him not to carry out a plot to poison the neighbor’s puppy, which had been barking for hours, keeping him from his writing.When you’re looking at the person you adore more than anything in the world, how can you force yourself to also see who’s actually standing right in front of you?Werewolf movies always have a scene where the afflicted person, still in human form, gets caught outdoors with their lover, just as night begins to fall. Once they catch a glimpse of that full moon, they realize what’s coming: They beg, then scream at their beloved to run away, to save themselves. But the lover thinks it’s a joke, or a flirtation, or even a poorly timed breakup. So they stand their ground, and laugh, or argue, or cry, or get indignant. But they never leave until it’s too late. Because when you’re looking at the person you adore more than anything in the world, how can you force yourself to also see who’s actually standing right in front of you?For seven years, we’d cheered each other on, shared everything, hatched a thousand plots to grow our careers, creative lives, and family. He was the first person to insist I drop everything and start writing, my fears and sense of inadequacy be damned. He loved me harder and believed in me more deeply than I’d ever had reason to dream about.And now he was behaving this way because he was suffering on a level I couldn’t fathom. His pain, we both understood, eclipsed anything he could have possibly inflicted back on me. And I understood this, too — between the rent I was shouldering, the storms I navigated us through, the near-constant falling out with friends, family, and colleagues — he could not survive without me.So I kept roasting those Tuesday night chickens. Because even this man, who had come to believe I was actively conspiring to ruin his life, couldn’t bite into one of those perfectly seasoned drumsticks and not taste unfaltering love. A wife’s love.He would recognize me, and return to himself, to both of us, because where else could he go? We belonged to one another.I loved my husband. I loved him so much. I never actually stopped.I just stopped coming home.A week after I left I received a long, apologetic text. Paragraphs that included the words “I’d do anything to smell one of your chickens in the oven.”It seems hilarious now that he would try to tempt me back home by asking me to cook him a meal. At the time, however, it wasn’t wholly ineffective. I was jerked back to the illusion of a home that floats on the scent of a dinner prepared with care. The memories made my hands shake.Once I moved, I roasted more chickens. To christen my new apartment, to feed friends who marveled at how well I seemed to be doing, given the circumstances. It dawned on me that those golden birds were the ultimate act of love, spiked with garlic, and no one deserved it more than them. I made them because once we’d eaten every morsel, I could boil the bones into a soup that tasted even more deeply of comfort. Of home and family, and all those seemingly fixed notions that had turned on their heads in just a few weeks.All that life-affirming goodness, the strength and energy buried within the marrow, was drawn out when it found itself in hot water.Just like me.When I eventually started dating someone, we agreed to keep it casual. In my kitchen, full of bravado and IPAs, I fed him a line I’d tried on my girlfriends a few nights before: “It’s hard to be a woman: Someone makes you come a few times and the next thing you know, there’s a damn chicken in the oven.”He looked over at me and said, “I can make the chicken.” Like it was the most obvious thing in the world. I was too shocked to respond.But I let him. And it was delicious.This essay is part of a partnership between Human Parts and The Chorus, a new publication about relationships, dating, and friendship from Chorus.Written by"
35,White Fever Dreams,"The new West Side Story revival attempts to reinterpret the classical music for a contemporary audience in a fraught political climate. It is Romeo and Juliet, but with tattoos and ripped clothing and barely suppressed rage rolling beneath the skin of every character. It is a story of old immigrants versus new immigrants, and how people living on the margins are forced to fight for the little scrap of the world they share. The cast is multiracial and the Sharks are played by actual people of color instead of white actors in brown face so that, I suppose, is progress. The Jets are not just disaffected white men but also black.The stage is vast and ominously bare. The most interesting parts of the set — Doc’s store and the bridal shop, are found deep into the stage and parts are hidden from view. When action takes place in those spaces, it is projected onto massive screens, stretching across the stage. Sometimes, cast members film the action on stage. Other times, pre-recorded segments supplement the live action. Like far too many shows in recent years, West Side Story relies heavily, too heavily in fact, on projections that are expected to do the work stagecraft should.Tonally, this West Side Story is significantly different from the original. “Gee, Officer Krupke,” is the most reimagined and affecting number. In the original, the song is supposed to be a farcical but prescient romp. In this revival, it becomes a commentary on police brutality and what it means to live in a surveillance state. The staging of this number is smart, if a bit heavy-handed, and a necessary reminder of the ways black and brown men are imperiled by systemic racism.Taken one way, fear is this revival’s center of gravity and the talented cast acquit themselves well to the task. The choreography is frenetic and electrifying. The singing is raw, rough and angry. As dancers, the cast is uniformly talented though not every cast member has a strong enough voice to handle the show’s vocal demands. Shereen Pimental, as Maria, is the real standout. Her voice is flawless, and she has a magnetic stage presence. Tony, played by Isaac Powell, is a formidable actor with genuine appeal, but his voice falters and cannot adequately carry the passion of “Maria” or the yearning of “Somewhere.” Yesenia Ayala captivates as Anita when she’s on stage and is a formidable dancer, deliberate and confident in her movement.And then there is Amar Ramasar, who plays Bernardo, Maria’s brother and the leader of the Sharks. On the night I saw the show, still in previews, there were several protestors in front of the Broadway Theatre, with posters warning theatregoers about a sexual predator in the cast. I had no idea who they were protesting until the next day when I learned Ramasar was fired from the New York City Ballet for sharing nude pictures of a woman in the company without her consent. Though I was unaware, the show’s producers certainly knew of his history and clearly didn’t care. Only eighteen months passed between when Ramasar was fired from the ballet and when he began performing as Bernardo. The quality of his performance is irrelevant but if talent was a justifiable reason to overlook sexual misconduct, Ramasar’s presence in the show is wildly unjustified. It is all but impossible to respect a show that shows so little respect for itself or the women in its cast.Overall, the experience of West Side Story is kind of unpleasant but all things considered, discomfort is appropriate. There is a generation of young people who must deal with a burning planet, unchecked gun violence that is somehow supposed to abate with the power of thoughts and prayer, unchecked police brutality, the erosion of privacy, the downfall of democracy, stagnant wages and limited job opportunities, staggering student loan debt, healthcare as a privilege instead of a right, rising rents and home ownership as an elusive fantasy. A show that tries to speak to this reality demands setting complacency and comfort aside.There is a generation of young people who must deal with a burning planet, unchecked gun violence that is somehow supposed to abate with the power of thoughts and prayerThe new staging seems quite forward-looking and inclusive but most of the creative and production team is comprised of white people. Ivo van Hove, Belgian, directs and Anne Teresa DeKeersmaeker, Dutch, choreographs this new staging. They are accomplished and talented, certainly, and they do bring a sharp and interesting energy to this revival. But how committed can a show be to genuine inclusion when people of color have little or no hand in the show’s artistic voice and direction? How authentic can the portrayals of people of color be when it is predominantly white people shaping those portrayals?The show’s attempts at inclusion are, at times, clumsily executed. The black Jets would have more solidarity with the Puerto Rican Sharks than the white Jets. That they don’t in this show is the misstep of people who did not bother to learn much about the cultures they tried to represent. During “Gee Officer Krupke,” there are, among others, images of the border wall between the United States and Mexico. It’s clear what they are trying to say but it is also cognitively dissonant because Puerto Rico is part of the United States, and it is an island and the show is set in present day. To flatten the experience immigration without nuance makes it seem like the show’s architects think all brown people and their experiences are interchangeable.In graduate school many years ago, we read a book in a pedagogy seminar about racial discrimination in higher education. One of my classmates said she took the book and its claims more seriously when she realized the author was white. I’ve never forgotten that. For a great many people, whiteness is synonymous with authority. Whiteness endows people with this presumed authority on any subject including the experiences of people of color.It is interesting to consider the cultural missteps of West Side Story as the literary world remains embroiled in a debate about Jeanine Cummin’s American Dirt. In the novel, Lydia and her young son Luca must flee Mexico after members of the fictional Los Jardineros cartel murder their entire family as they celebrate a quinceanera. If there is a cliché about Mexico, Cummins finds a way to exhaust it. Lydia’s backstory is realized through flashbacks and the revelation of the catalyst for the massacre is so facile, so absurd. The pace is breathless, Lydia trying desperately to get her child to safety, and it is the one thing that works well. As a thriller demands, Lydia and Luca face obstacle after obstacle after obstacle. As relentless as the novel is, the ending falters because what, really, is there to say after our protagonists, flatly drawn, more caricature than character, experience every possible trauma.At the end of the book is a very long, very self-serving author’s note — a way of pre-empting controversy but instead, it inflames. Cummins says she wanted to humanize the migrants who are trying to cross the United States border but who, exactly is she trying to do this for? Who cannot see other people with whom we are sharing this planet as human? Who cannot empathize with what we know of how treacherous the journey into the United States can be? Who cannot empathize with families being separated, children being kept in cages? If a poorly written and conceived novel is what it takes, are these people we really want to reach?Cummins says she wanted to humanize the migrants who are trying to cross the United States border but who, exactly is she trying to do this for? Who cannot see other people with whom we are sharing this planet as human?Cummins has repeatedly discussed the extensive research she conducted. In fairness, you do see evidence of research on the pages of American Dirt. In fact, the book screams, “Look at me! I have done my research,” which happens when a writer desperately wants you to know they really, truly, have put in the necessary work to credibly write their book. There is a difference, though, between conducting research and synthesizing the significance of what you have learned. Time and again, Cummins demonstrates her cultural ignorance that no amount of research can overcome. For one, Lydia and Luca are Mexican when most of the migrants trying to cross the border are Central American. Lydia is a bookshop owner who displays her young son at the front of her store where white tourists marvel at his knowledge of geography as if a mother would willingly treat her child like an animal in a zoo. There are so many avoidable missteps in American Dirt, places where the author is clearly intellectualizing experiences she knows nothing about or is incapable of truly understanding.The author also tries, tenuously, to create connections between her life and the migrant experience. She talks about trauma and tragedy in her family. She talks about her Irish husband, an undocumented immigrant before their marriage, but she acts as if an undocumented white man who arrived by airplane is at all comparable to any undocumented person of color. In a 2016 New York Times op-ed about a traumatic experience in her family, Cummins wrote, “I am white.” In the months leading up to the publishing of American Dirt, she began to claim Puerto Rican identity by way of a grandmother, going so far as to include the word “Boricua” in her Twitter bio treating racial identity like a costume. It would have been better if Cummins had simply written the book she wanted to write and allowed the critical reception to unfold without her clumsy attempts to control it.The publishing industry functions within an entire ecosystem of ignorance. In 2019, publisher Flatiron Books hosted a dinner in support of American Dirt. The centerpieces were small concrete walls wrapped in barbed wire, surrounded by candles and flowers. It was a thoughtless, callous display and no one, at least publicly, thought anything was wrong with aestheticizing trauma. An editor chose to buy this book, for an astonishing seven figures. Publicists worked to promote this book with great enthusiasm. If there were objections during the publication process, we will never know, and they probably went unheard because the people most likely to object had the least power or position to do so. I’m not sure what’s worse — that the team behind American Dirt did not anticipate the critical response or that they did, and simply didn’t care.If there were objections during the publication process, we will never know, and they probably went unheard because the people most likely to object had the least power or position to do so.Famous writers like Stephen King, Julia Alvarez, and Sandra Cisneros blurbed the book. The book will be translated into more than twenty languages. It was reviewed twice in the New York Times, and also received coverage in The Washington Post, The Atlantic, NPR, The Guardian, and The Los Angeles Times. While some reviews were negative, several were rapturous. Shortly before the book’s publication, Oprah announced that American Dirt was the latest selection for her popular book club and since, the book has sold robustly. It has received the most powerful endorsement in the literary word, despite its failings. American Dirt was positioned to succeed and despite the so-called backlash, this book has done exactly that. That such a flawed book was anointed and elevated while books by writers of color are ignored, unpublished, or inadequately compensated or supported, is the bitterest of pills to swallow. Writer Myriam Gurba wrote a necessary and scathing review of American Dirt, calling out the author’s inadequacy to the task of writing about the perils of migration, the surfeit of clichés, the inept characterizations, the abject failure of the project. “Dirt is a Frankenstein of a book, a clumsy and distorted spectacle and while some white critics have compared Cummins to Steinbeck, I think a more apt comparison is to Vanilla Ice,” she concluded. Since her review was published, she has received harassment and threats for daring to take this book and author to task.Creativity demands that anyone should be able to tell the kinds of stories they want, but how those stories are told matters and creative freedom does not grant critical immunity. Perfection isn’t the goal, but accuracy and authenticity are. When people tell stories beyond their subject position, all too often they do it poorly. The depictions are caricatures, rife with stereotypes, flat and distorted. The people whose communities are so poorly represented speak up but are rarely heard. Writers are allowed to make mistakes.Writers are allowed to write bad books. To critique American Dirt isn’t about jealousy or misogyny or censorship. It’s about demanding better.Creativity demands that anyone should be able to tell the kinds of stories they want, but how those stories are told matters and creative freedom does not grant critical immunity.We seem to have forgotten that books are supposed to be discussed and vigorously critiqued. Unfortunately, we have a diminished culture of literary criticism, one where most books are not substantively engaged with and where readers and writers expect either unequivocal praise or polite silence.Both West Side Story and American Dirt were supposed to tell big and bold, new and innovative stories about black and brown people, but in their execution, they were fever dreams of white people. That is a very old story, indeed. Lest you think audiences are deterred, American Dirt debuted on the New York Times bestseller list at №1. West Side Story is running at 100% capacity and for the week ending on January 26th, it was the fourth highest grossing show on Broadway. Both the publishing and theatre communities have been wringing their hands for years about diversity and inclusion, and creating space for a multitude of voices. And still, they never make the real efforts to practice inclusivity rather than simply lamenting the need for it. They never put the sustained material support behind diversity and inclusion initiatives. They refuse to develop institutional fail-safes to ensure that the best possible work is being made. Given the success of both American Dirt and West Side Story, they clearly have little incentive to do so.Written by"
36,How To Become Emotionally Self-Sufficient,"There’s a German saying that translates like this: The worst way of missing someone is to sit next to them, knowing they’ll never be with you.For three years, I had sat next to her, and it was never going to work. Three long years of being in love with my best friend, that’s what it took for me to finally admit: “I will never be with this girl.”I distinctly remember the day. It’s one of those rare memories you can access like a Youtube video. You click a button, and, instantly, you can see it. Clearly.When I hit play on this one, I see myself sitting at my desk, crying. I was 18 years old. I don’t cry a lot, but this one hurt. Deep down, I had known for a while we’d never be together, but it was still overwhelming.As much as I felt sad, I also felt relieved. Finally, I was free. Finally, I could move on. Some of my tears were happy tears. This is the most distinct part of the memory. I sat in my desk chair, thinking: “Well, at least I still have myself. I guess I’ll always have myself.”Sometimes, I joke that, whenever I have to be alone, at least I’ll be in good company. It’s funny, but it’s also true. I can’t trace back this feeling any further than that memory. That day, I understood a huge emotional investment had failed, but I also realized my parents raised me to be my own best friend.That’s a lot to take in, and that’s why I was crying.Emotional self-sufficiency is the foundation of good mental health. It’s also fertile ground for happiness. The better you can deal with your emotions, the more positive moments you can extract from even the worst of situations.Finally, emotional maturity is attractive in the most literal sense of the world. When you can identify, analyze, process, and manage your feelings well, the world takes notice. Opportunities, responsibilities, and relationships start gravitating towards you because people know you can handle them.I was lucky. I lived a sheltered, complete childhood. Few people get that. But I also never stopped working on myself. In the ten years that followed that memory, I maintained and improved my ability to identify, accept, act on and move on from my emotions.You can’t change your upbringing after the fact, but you can work on emotional self-sufficiency. Emotionally mature people have certain traits. By emulating them as best as you can, you can learn to take responsibility for your feelings.It’s a slow process, not always easy, and there is no one right way to do it, but here are three exercises that have given me strength and stability throughout the years.The hardest and most important part of emotional self-sufficiency is not running away when your feelings make you uncomfortable.It’s easy to gloss over negative emotions and “try to stay positive,” as we’re often told. Sadly, doing so further obfuscates our feelings rather than clarify them. We may think we’ve handled our sadness, fear, or disappointment when, actually, we haven’t even identified which one causes our discomfort.This is the first task of emotional self-sufficiency: finding emotional clarity. It requires spending time with yourself, thinking, and holding off on judgments so you don’t jump to false conclusions.Our age affects our ability to label emotionally laden situations, and, usually, we become worse at it as we grow up. When do you ever hear an adult say, “I’m afraid?” Children, however, confess to being scared all the time. Of course, they are less burdened with responsibilities. Kids have time. As adults, we must make said time to gain emotional clarity.Before I had my “breakthrough,” I spent many nights sitting by myself, mulling over the situation with my then-best friend. Few of them led to tangible answers, but they all fed into the final revelation.The second part of being emotionally responsible is sitting with what you have identified. Like waiting for the initial fog to clear, this requires emotional tolerance. Your feelings can’t kill you, but it is only when you sit with the bad ones and realize the world keeps turning that you start trusting in this fact.Today, our challenges are almost exclusively emotional. Leaning into your feelings gives you the power to accept them without letting them hijack your behavior. You want to act, not react. What distinguishes the two is a plan; a plan formed with time.Sitting with your emotions as a standalone activity is crucial to separating other people’s behavior from how you feel about said behavior. Initially, our gut tells us the two are one and the same, but they’re not. For example, while I was angry that the girl I was in love with didn’t reciprocate my feelings, I had no idea what she felt or why she acted the way she did. So who was I to judge? It was my anger, and all I could do was resolve it — and that took time.The next time you feel particularly uncomfortable, tempted to act on an impulse, or as if you’re on the verge of a nervous breakdown, go home. Sit. Make some tea. Put on some music. Think. Rest. Let your true feelings bubble to the surface, and then take a bath inside those emotions.It may still feel uncomfortable at first, but after a while, you’ll get a sense of relief and new clarity on what’s going on inside your body and mind.Writing is thinking. Every sentence has structure. You can’t write without structuring your thoughts, and since your thoughts are your responses to your emotions, writing is structuring your emotional responses.There are countless forms of writing. None of them demand you publicly post your results, but almost all of them let you shape your emotional landscape.There’s journaling, which you can do in a five-minute format, by answering a single question, along certain themes, like Stoicism, or in a free-writing style where you document your stream of consciousness in real-time. There are quizzes and personality tests, the idea of a personal manifesto, and many lists of values, rules, and principles, all of which can facilitate emotional clarity.Once you’ve picked up on certain character traits, attitudes, or beliefs you hold — if even just for a period of time — identifying how you feel about and want to handle things gets easier in similar, future situations.Meditation is humility in its purest form. You just sit there. You don’t act. You don’t think. At least, you’re not trying to. For a few minutes a day, you allow yourself to merely exist, and you teach yourself that that’s actually okay.I used to think meditation was about self-awareness, but it’s also about non-judgment. You’ll learn to not label your thoughts, feelings, and experiences so quickly. Sometimes, you’ll even realize you can’t decide if something is good or bad at all — and you just accept it as is.For the past 150 days, I have meditated each day. Usually, I do it for 15 minutes after waking up, but even as little as five minutes helps.By tuning in to yourself and listening to what comes to the surface, you gain emotional clarity. You also practice emotional tolerance, as you’re literally just tolerating the passage of time. Finally, it lets you approach situations more humbly, as you’re not so quick to judge.There are many ways to meditate, but I like the simple version: Just sit comfortably, close your eyes, and reset your train of thought when you catch yourself chasing a mental path. Sometimes, I focus on my breath or the noises in my environment, but as long as I make an effort to stay present, it works.Start with a few minutes a day, ease in to what might feel uncomfortable at first, and then go from there.Emotional self-sufficiency isn’t being immune to losing your shit. We all have moments of overwhelm and despair. It’s about not letting those moments dictate your life.It takes a lot of standing up to catch yourself when you fall, but if you can do both, you’ll always land safely, even when the touchdown isn’t soft. You’ll have faith in yourself and feel you can handle whatever life throws at you. You’ll be calmer, more stable, and attract many good things in your life, from happiness to opportunities and relationships.Get a journal. Meditate a little. Make time to sit with your emotions. Give these exercises a try. The next time you find yourself shedding a tear, maybe you’ll remember that, at least you’ll always have yourself.Written by"
37,4 Japanese Concepts to Transform Your State of Mind,"Japan has a famed rich culture and philosophy, but I confess I did not appreciate this enough until my first trip. At 21, I was a Karate black belt and thought far too much of my own ability.The training involved lots of head nodding at Japanese words being used without really being explained. You knew you were doing something wrong but didn’t quite know why.That all changed in the beautiful islands of Okinawa.Traveling to the birthplace of Karate transformed my understanding. The instructors there have dedicated their lives to the art form and inspired me to dive into the philosophical elements, not just looking cool.The lessons Japanese philosophy teaches can be applied to all aspects of our lives.We can often allow our minds to float and be forced to react to the challenges that life throws at us. We can, however, practice and discipline our minds to do so much more.Mind without mind sounds wishy-washy, yet for those who have experienced it, there is no better feeling.This mindset is where your inner voice is silent. You act purely based on instinct and feel. For many of us who are continually worrying, mental silence is incredibly freeing.In sports, it is often called being in “The Zone,” where everything just seems to flow for a player.Meditation is a tried and tested way to attain “Mushin no shin,” yet meditation is not something that appeals to everyone.Have you ever aimlessly gone for a walk, and your legs just have taken you around without any conscious decisions about where you are going? Total empty mindedness, but your subconscious guides you.People experience “Mushin no shin” in a vast array of fields. People report it in physical activities such as dance, running, karate, and others find it in mental or creative areas such as painting or doing sudoku.I believe everyone should have an activity that gives them this feeling. We all struggle when we first start an activity because we must think so hard about what we are doing. Getting through this difficulty eventually leads to cognitive ease.The key to “Mushin no shin” is consistency in whichever activity you choose. This activity then becomes an oasis during your day or week.While I would caution against trying to force this mindset to be used productively rather than purely for mental health, it is possible to achieve in a working environment too.Have you ever had a day where it’s just flown by, and you have no idea where the time went? It happens when you have all the necessary skills for your tasks, and your brain simply plows through.It can be great for the first attempt or draft of a piece of work. Instead of your inner voice assessing every word or action you make, you let it run wild and afterward in a more focused state can edit and revise.You may already have activities that put your brain into this state. If you do, make sure you make time for this and see how it lifts your overall mood. If you do not, what are you waiting for!Conjure the image of a samurai in your mind. What many will think of is a majestic warrior with an extreme discipline that exudes calm.On January 1st, many of us were in this state of mind. We would complete our New Year’s Resolution, no matter what.Unfortunately, it’s all too easy to fall out of this state of mind. True “Fudoshin” is an irresistible will to reach our target that will bulldoze through any distraction, whether internal or external.Often “Fudoshin” can work against us. If you have a sweet tooth, you know no matter what reasoning or logic you use, you will eat that cake.We can train ourselves to harness this state for good. Whenever trying to give up something, whether it’s smoking, snacks, or meat, a refusal to entertain the possibility that you will fail will work. It is saying ‘No’ instantly and firmly.A straightforward way to practice this mindset and gain confidence for more difficult tasks is delaying gratification. Studies have shown that this is a reliable indicator of success.If you’re addicted to your phone. Try to decide that you will not look at it for the next X minutes. Do this regularly until there’s no doubt in your mind at all that you’ll get through your time.Then try a slightly more laborious task and roll on to tackle more and more challenging situations.The greatest mistake people make when trying to harness “Fudoshin” is setting their aims to high too quickly. Instead of deciding to go to the gym every single day, start with going to the gym at least once a week with no excuses.This easier task develops the desire to harness the excellent control you have inside.Right now, I am using “Fudoshin” that I will complete this article and publish it regardless of the other distractions of my life.“Fudoshin” can be applied in all areas of life. If you make a promise to a friend, then you will not break it, there are no ifs or buts. Even more importantly, if you make a promise to yourself, then you will not let yourself down and won’t even consider that possibility.Finals are littered with stories of glory moments where a team comes from behind to steal the trophy at the last moment.This is what happens when “Fudoshin” meets a lack of “Zanshin.”“Zanshin” is where even when a task is going well, and everything seems alright, you do not allow the mind to relax. It’s a laser focus that only ends when the mission is complete.Many of us will be guilty of starting to win and getting ahead of ourselves and becoming complacent. Whether it is in work or play, it’s always disappointing to be snatched from the loving embrace of victory at the last moment.We must appreciate what got us to our advantageous position and not let our guard down.It doesn’t matter if you were winning for 99% of the contest if you lose it at the very end. In politics, the belief that Brexit or Trump could never win may have led to weaker opposition campaigns and then shock defeats.Multitasking is ineffective whenever both tasks are cognitively difficult. Yet we still try to do so.If you are working while also thinking about something from your personal life, then you will not be as effective.Following a “Zanshin” mindset means resolute focus until the task is complete because allowing the mind to wander can and probably will backfire.To train “Zanshin,” be ruthless with your attention. If you are out with dinner with friends, then you are out with dinner with friends until the last moment. Do not start thinking about tomorrow while you are with them, as they will remember you zoning out at the end!If more people maintained “Shoshin,” the world would be a better place.How often have you gone into a conversation wanting to prove the other person wrong?Our brains are capable of incredible learning and growth, but this is only possible if our minds are open to new information.Our existing views and prejudices get in the way of our potential.Being good is the enemy of being great.Many people obtain black belts and then give up because they think they know everything. However, with hindsight, I learned more in the first year post-black belt then the entire time preceding.It is unnervingly common for people to follow a view of an influencer on Twitter and believe that they are now experts on the topic. We see this, especially with politically charged issues.An essential aspect of Shoshin is the acceptance that you can be wrong, and you can grow and adapt. If you can never believe you are wrong, how will you ever grow?“Shoshin” can also be applied to personal relationships. We can sometimes convince ourselves that a person has acted with specific intentions despite having no evidence! “Shoshin” means listening and trying to understand others and being open to apologizing.One of the most challenging aspects of maintaining “Shoshin” is maintaining conviction at the same time. Being open does not mean being riddled with self-doubt.Paradoxically, people living with forms of anxiety can believe they are wrong often, and here the idea that needs to be grown and adapted is that they are not always wrong. Absolutes in the world are rare.Believe in yourself and critically your ability to grow. None of us are perfect, nor will we ever be, and that’s ok. Letting go of this idea gives us space to develop without guilt.As a practice exercise, think about the last argument you had. Try to put yourself in the other person’s shoes and think about what their arguments were and whether any of them could be valid.Read articles by people with different opinions with you and try to understand their perspective. This does not mean that you must change your mind, but at the very least, you will have learned something about how others think.Sometimes you will come across someone malicious, yet this should not be our base position for everyone we disagree with.This article highlights four states of mind from Japanese philosophy:Thank you for reading this article, I hope you can apply some of the lessons to improve your mental wellbeing.Written by"
38,Review: RetinaNet — Focal Loss (Object Detection),"In this story, RetinaNet, by Facebook AI Research (FAIR), is reviewed. It is discovered that there is extreme foreground-background class imbalance problem in one-stage detector. And it is believed that this is the central cause which makes the performance of one-stage detectors inferior to two-stage detectors.In RetinaNet, an one-stage detector, by using focal loss, lower loss is contributed by “easy” negative samples so that the loss is focusing on “hard” samples, which improves the prediction accuracy. With ResNet+FPN as backbone for feature extraction, plus two task-specific subnetworks for classification and bounding box regression, forming the RetinaNet, which achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforms Faster R-CNN, the well-known two-stage detectors. It is a 2017 ICCV Best Student Paper Award paper with more than 500 citations. (The first author, Tsung-Yi Lin, has become Research Scientist at Google Brain when he was presenting RetinaNet in 2017 ICCV.) (Sik-Ho Tsang @ Medium)By using focal loss, the total loss can be balanced adaptively between easy samples and hard samples.[2017 ICCV] [RetinaNet]Focal Loss for Dense Object DetectionImage Classification[LeNet] [AlexNet] [ZFNet] [VGGNet] [SPPNet] [PReLU-Net] [DeepImage] [GoogLeNet / Inception-v1] [BN-Inception / Inception-v2] [Inception-v3] [Inception-v4] [Xception] [MobileNetV1] [ResNet] [Pre-Activation ResNet] [RiR] [RoR] [Stochastic Depth] [WRN] [FractalNet] [Trimps-Soushen] [PolyNet] [ResNeXt] [DenseNet]Object Detection[OverFeat] [R-CNN] [Fast R-CNN] [Faster R-CNN] [DeepID-Net] [R-FCN] [ION] [MultiPathNet] [NoC] [G-RMI] [TDM] [SSD] [DSSD] [YOLOv1] [YOLOv2 / YOLO9000] [FPN]Semantic Segmentation[FCN] [DeconvNet] [DeepLabv1 & DeepLabv2] [ParseNet] [DilatedNet] [PSPNet] [DeepLabv3]Biomedical Image Segmentation[CUMedVision1] [CUMedVision2 / DCAN] [U-Net] [CFS-FCN] [U-Net+ResNet]Instance Segmentation[DeepMask] [SharpMask] [MultiPathNet] [MNC] [InstanceFCN] [FCIS]Super Resolution[SRCNN] [FSRCNN] [VDSR] [ESPCN] [RED-Net]Written by"
39,I Transformed My Figure in One Year,"As is so typical for this time of year, Medium and media in general are both flush with articles about body overhauls.We are as nation obsessed with our bodies, and so when the New Year rolls around, by god this is the year to do it right. Whatever IT happens to be. Lose weight, exercise more, yadda yadda.Rinse, repeat.For those of us with more than two decades under our belts, we don’t write as many resolutions as much younger folk, if for no other reason than we’ve been known to greet the New Year by writing about losing weight while wielding a donut in the other hand.Boy is my hand up. You learn to develop a sense of humor about the whole process.Not just that, but after a while the get-thin-quick schemes are the same as get-rich-quick schemes which are the same as pretty much all schemes for that matter.Get lathered up, rinse, repeat.One of the reasons I write about fitness after fifty is that I land in that very narrow category of folks who dumped one hell of a lot of weight a very long time ago and have managed to keep it off. For anyone who, like me, has tried every diet under the sun and the moon included, not only have I completely trashed my metabolism (it’s very slow, trust me, after what I did) but I will never quite be able to eat the daily recommended for my age and weight.Look, I’m thin, and muscular, but given my activity level, any dietician would recommend easily twice the calories I consume right now. I can’t do that. Because once you’ve exorcised (note I did NOT say exercise) that extra poundage, the body makes the decision to slow down and begins the lifelong negotiation to get it all back.Well, shit.I can attest. However I’ve been successful for 33 years and counting. I rise a few pounds from stress, it goes away. I drop a few pounds on a trip, it comes back. The difference is that not only is it manageable, it’s not something that determines my daily happiness. Being fit does. Having strength and mobility and flexibility add to my happiness, for I have options one hell of a lot of folks don’t. At any age. I’ve been willing to do the work. And no, it’s not fun to be this disciplined. But I don’t care for the alternatives.By now I have more than thirty years’ of practice. I didn’t dump 80 lbs just last year. And therein lies the issue I have withFirst of all, that’s a ridiculous promise. The writer doesn’t have a clue what’s going to work for anyone but himself. But that clickbait title got him more than five thousand views. Because we are gullible, and we want easy answers, and look if it worked for him, then…No.Besides, Sparky, let’s see that body in another year. Or five.While the article had some good advice, what was suggested assumed a number of things: that you’re young (being white and male don’t hurt either), have enough money to afford the suggested foods and gym membership, and haven’t spent a good part of your life on yo-yo diets which have already fucked up your metabolism.Which, kindly, given that some 40% of us in America are obese, is probably most of us.I can understand both the enthusiasm of the author as well as the eagerness of the readers to find THAT MAGIC THING THAT WORKS.There is none. There just isn’t any one thing, or any one program, that works. Period.Some years ago a good friend of mine, a fellow professional speaker, finally decided to get serious about his obesity. He had an enormous waistline and his friends and wife were concerned. He had a great fondness for grazing at all-you-can-eat smorgasbords. He turned that energy towards the Body for Life program.Phillips’ website featured endless Before and Afters. We LOVE Before and After photos. We wanna be that After. My buddy threw himself into it. He made one fatal mistake. He was in his mid-sixties. He decided that he was going to return his much-abused, badly out of shape body to his early twenties. So he carried around a photo of a professional body builder and told all of us that this was what he was going to look like in twelve weeks.I don’t need to tell you what happened. His program stalled when he realized that not only was that completely out of the question, he couldn’t cope with the fact that even after having lost a very respectable fifty pounds, he would never, ever sport a 32"" waist again. He gave up, dumped the effort. Last time I saw him he was even bigger. He wanted an After he couldn’t reach. And my guess is that if you and I researched all those other Body for Life Afters, a good portion of them didn’t find that After was Forever After either.Having unrealistic expectations is guaranteed to torpedo you.And, for those who have lost a huge amount of weight, this happens. You come face to face with acres of rippling skin that used to stretch over all that fat, and now it just hangs. And, as the article points out, the BIG JOY doesn’t happen. Because the weight isn’t the issue. Never was. My life didn’t suddenly improve when the 80 lbs went away. That would be another twenty-four years later. And, these days, I have some sagging, which is a prime indicator that my skin was once full of a lot more of me. You ready to sign up for that? Yours could be sooner or later. No guarantee it will ever get better. Either way, it depends.Man I hate to bust 5000+ bubbles, but Dude, all you and I can do is speak to what works for our unique bodies. Telling people to work out certain body parts on different days? Well, kindly, that may not work for folks’ work schedules, maybe they can’t spring for a gym membership, perhaps they are infirm or obese or whatever and the exercises are just way too far out of the realm of possibility, or to get started requires a $100 an hour personal trainer.I could go on. Again, as with everything in life, it depends.Anyone can sustain high enthusiasm for a short term result (as in, getting laid) but when it becomes real work (as in, giving her an orgasm), ZZZZZZ.If you’re easily discouraged, and you have the expectation that your yeoman’s effort should result in a six-pack and you’re not a natural mesomorph, this could be a very frustrating journey.I don’t argue anyone’s right to brag about getting fitter, dropping the flab and being able to pose prettily for the camera in front of a karst outcropping in Thailand.For my health dollar, that’s no different from posting a fitness model on the wall at 24-Hour and implying that you, too, can look like this airbrushed dude who does nothing other than work out full time to look like that.People who write these articles are justifiably proud and they want to encourage others. However it strikes me as irresponsible to imply that just do this and you will get that. Because our bodies don’t work that way .Because those, and other tough but essential queries will cut the eyeballs down to the few who really will be inspired.There are some basics, which are perfectly outlined here. But there is also this, which is essential for those who are currently carrying a great deal more weight. The human body is a quirk machine and as such, Diet #1 is perfect for Billy Bob and for shit for Norma Jean. For damned good reason.Bottom line, this whole fitness thing is such a unique journey. There is no one body style that is perfect, only what you have, and the best fitness you can hope to achieve based on your work ethic. And, finding something you enjoy.There is only ONE version of you, and because of that, only YOU can determine what works for you. You can hire help via a nutritionist, a dietician, a doctor, a trainer. But ultimately, no matter what magical formula some happy dude or dudette on Medium or elsewhere used, it is meaningless when it comes to determining what is going to work for you.Just ask me. I’ve had 33 years of practice. I wouldn’t tell you to do it my way because I’m all I can fit in this skin suit. There’s no room for you in here (there used to be, but I like the extra room in the hips). You gotta figure that out your own.And besides, I really am not terribly interested in anyone else’s Big Success Story until they’ve kept it up like my Medium Peep Katie Andrews, who went from 425 to 160. Now it’s been years.Not days.That’s what makes a success story. Sustainable. Enjoyable. A lifestyle.What worked for Katie wouldn’t work for me. Or you. Or likely anyone else. We all have to tweak constantly as we evolve.Damn, man. It all comes back around to much the same thing.So yes, I did transform my body in a year. Thirty three years ago. And no, I’m not telling you my diet or exercise plan. Trust me, you would not do what I do to be able to do what I do in the world. Very few people would (and besides, I wouldn’t wish my injuries on you).What I do is fun for me and looks like torture to any (sane, sober, otherwise competent) human being.This is your body. Your year. Your journey. Wanna be fit? Stop reading other peoples’ stories and go write your own.Written by"
40,That Good Ol’ Fashioned Grey-Area Depression,"A couple months back, a young woman asked me how she could delineate between sadness and depression. Did she deserve to call herself “a depressed person”? She wasn’t sure. I told her my personal Depression Litmus Test is when I take a right at sadness and drive straight off a cliff into a sea of I Don’t Care. “I’m less productive, I feel like everything I’m doing is pointless, I stop caring about things I normally would,” I wrote.It didn’t surprise me that she would second-guess her emotions. Many people have a limited understanding of what depression looks like (so many looks!). And even those of us who do know can still find ourselves competing for legitimacy in the Depression Olympics (sponsored by Twitter, probably). Did I eat enough cheese today? Could my sweatpants use a couple more stains? Does this two-month bender put me in the running for the title? The depression title, of course. Sometimes it feels like it has to be earned, as though simply being depressed isn’t enough. That in owning the title, you also have to own the nebulous persona that comes with it.But depression isn’t a persona. It’s a mood disorder and an illness, not a uniform one throws on to express their inner turmoil. There are several depressive disorders as outlined by the DSM 5 — add to that subjective life experience and a multitude of mental health variables, and it’s difficult to argue that depression could ever manifest as a one-size-fits-all, grey-scale cloak. Your depression could look very different from someone else’s, different from the archetype — but that doesn’t invalidate it. And that doesn’t make it harmless.I know this. So why, after moving cross-country to Los Angeles, did it take months of lethargy, apathy, and nihilism for me to recognize what was happening?The first time I felt depressed… what a funny-sad way to start a sentence. As if I know. I used to have this tidy little depression origin story: things were just swell until the year I turned thirteen. That year, 1999, my family and I abruptly moved from Brooklyn to a suburb of New York City. The move made me aware of a few things: 1) I could not trust my treasonous parents, 2) The only person who mourned my moving away was me, 3) cutting myself was an adequate way to deal with items 1) and 2).This narrative worked for me for a long time. I remember vividly the pain of leaving the apartment I grew up in, my friends, my neighborhood. I remember transforming the journal I kept for English class into a tortured babble book — crying and bleeding directly onto the pages, purposely writing through meltdowns to convey, through shaky handwriting, how fucked I was. How fucked everything was. I remember graduating from bobby pin to scissors to knife in the cavernous bedroom with the air mattress and the beige, wall-to-wall carpeting.But in packing for my recent move west, I discovered my origin story might’ve begun before that. Before I left Brooklyn, which I would go on to mythologize as The Place Where Nothing Bad Ever Happened. The evidence that my narrative was incomplete came in the form of an old letter from my best friend, circa sixth grade. It was written in purple milk pen and while the pages were water-warped, the words were still legible. “Please don’t kill yourself!” And “I’m depressed, too — but don’t end it. If you wanna runaway, I know a place that can help us,” my friend wrote. I don’t know what I wrote to her to prompt this response. I do know I was eleven.It’s tempting to dismiss my feelings as those of a mid-puberty, emotional tween, but as I would go on to attempt suicide at fifteen, I’m not sure that’s accurate. I’m also not sure what was so terrible for eleven-year-old me — perhaps nothing. Perhaps this thing was inherited, same as my freckles, the color of my eyes. Who knows? What I do know is that these formative experiences went on to define depression as it pertained to me: it involved crying for hours on end, self-harm, and the constant feeling that the world would be fine without me in it.By that definition, I was not depressed when I moved to California. In fact, those first few weeks were abnormally blissful. Moving cross-country, alone, was a feat I hadn’t imagined myself capable of — I even began therapy earlier that year for the express purpose of building up the internal tools I was lacking just to pull it off.I landed at LAX on a Postcard October Day and knew almost instantly that I would not miss the autumn creep that had already taken hold of New York. I would not miss the clockwork depression that promised to visit the season after that, either. Finding an apartment I could afford by myself was the cherry on my self-sufficiency cake. Moving to LA made me feel like both an adult and a teenager at the same time — but not the teenager I’d been. Not the cutter. Not the cryer. I was a Polaroid teen, living in a perpetual golden hour. I was sunbeam beamin’. I was, by all accounts, not depressed. Not immediately, anyway, and even then, not in the way I’d come to define it.Self-medication is a bitch. It works, there’s no denying that. But how well? For how long? What’s worse: acknowledging that you’re depressed, or creating a new reason to feel bad about yourself while the old reasons drone on in the background?It took about two months for me to settle in after the move. To acquire an apartment, and then a desk, and then a chair suitable for desk-sitting. I gave myself permission, in the meantime, to work less and play more. Eventually, I’d return to my anxious, Type-A, Virgo self. I’d earn some money, write, make myself worthy of the life the former me had stitched together. But not yet.And then, not ever. I was partying a lot, enjoying the kind of freedom I had previously decided didn’t belong to me. She of no safety net, of no spousal or parental support. In New York, it made sense to live to work. I didn’t have many alternatives. But taking a time-out from the grind agreed with my body — more specifically, with my anxiety. Why go back to being that person? That palpitation-hearted, fire-chested person?It’s a strange thing — to care so much about every detail, to require medication to ward off the excessive, destructive worry — only to turn around and not care about anything.The depression I was accustomed to involved a lot of kicking and screaming. This was not that. This was laying in bed for days at a time until it felt like my spinal cord had melted into my mattress. Watching hundreds of hours of cancelled TV shows instead of responding to emails. Leaving bed only to heat a frozen pizza or to drink with friends. This was berating myself for being lazy, even as my “laziness” began to feel more like some unshakeable condition I’d had since birth. This was thinking, “You’d probably feel better if you went for a quick run, or maybe just stretched,” and, “It’s OK if you’re not gonna work today, but maybe reading a book would make you feel less shitty” — then ignoring that internal voice and pressing the “Continue Watching” button on Netflix.I had zero energy. Some days, I had zero emotions. I would walk around my apartment touching surfaces and craft supplies, almost amused by the way nothing warranted a response. “I feel like a robot,” I told a friend, robotically. When I managed to feel something, it was disdain for the act of caring. Why should I care?, I’d think, why should I care when we’re all gonna die? I didn’t necessarily want to die, I just became clear-eyed about the fact that it was an inevitability, one I’d done nothing to slow.During this period, I asked a friend if he thought he (we) maybe did some not-great things regarding his (our) health because he (we) figured it was only a matter of time. Do we hurt ourselves to speed up the process, to take ownership of our lives? If we’re to blame for our ultimate demise, doesn’t that take the control away from everyone, everything else? I still can’t decide if this line of thinking is a function of anxiety — worrying so much about death that you attempt to illogically defeat it by taking its options away, or depression — caring so little about your well-being that you actively assist in your own destruction. My guess is a little bit of both.Grey-area depression. It’s not a medical term, but it’s the best way to describe my first few months in California. On Consecutive Day #3 of laying in bed, I’d occasionally think, Maybe I’m depressed. Maybe. I just wasn’t sure, you know? Like the woman who wrote me, second-guessing her emotions. Like all of us for whom things feel bad, but not as bad as before — not as bad as the depressed character on that groundbreaking sitcom, not as bad as your depressed friend, whose suffering eclipses your own. Have we, those of us dwelling in the monochrome doldrums, earned the title?The problem with the grey area, with saying “maybe so,” is that you’re not compelled to figure out if there’s an actual problem. You find ways to write off all abnormal behavior: I just moved! I’m taking a self-care week! I’m just a disgusting, lazy, garbage human! And of course, the old standard: It’s just not that bad. Maybe it’s not, comparatively speaking, but there’s nothing good about it, either. And because I couldn’t differentiate between “not bad” and “good,” I spent months in cyclical malaise before talking to a professional and looking for solutions.So fuck the title. Fuck the archetype, the sweatpants, and the idea that you have to drown before you’re worth saving. Sometimes it’s enough to realize you’re sick of treading water.Written by"
41,How To Handle Other People’s Bad Moods Like a Pro,"Here’s a question I get asked a lot as a therapist:How do you sit there and listen to people’s problems all day? Don’t you get depressed?To be honest, not really.You might imagine that all the sadness, frustration, anxiety, and shame my clients tell me about would start to rub off on a guy after a while. But, if anything, I feel like I’m a little better at managing both my own emotions and other peoples’ because I get to practice all day long.The ability to manage other people’s bad moods and difficult emotions well is an ability that can be practiced and strengthened.What follows are 5 specific skills I’ve learned that help me to effectively and respectfully handle other people’s difficult emotions.If you can learn to cultivate them, these skills will help you keep your cool in every relationship in your life, especially the most important ones — like spouses, bosses, parents, partners, and children.When someone close to us is racked with anxiety, overwhelmed by sadness, or just incredibly frustrated, it’s natural to see their emotion as a problem — something to be taken care of and resolved quickly. This is why we so often turn to advice-giving when people we care about are upset.But as I’m sure you’ve come to learn, giving advice to someone in the throes of a bad mood is typically unhelpful at best and often counterproductive.Instead of viewing someone’s bad mood as a problem to be fixed, what if you shifted your perspective and saw it as a puzzle instead?Viewing someone’s emotion as a problem puts us in a moral frame of mind — we think of the emotion as something bad to be gotten rid of quickly.On the other hand, thinking of it as a puzzle puts us in a mindset of curiosity. And when we’re curious about another person’s emotion, it’s far easier to be validating, understanding, and empathetic, which is what most people experiencing strong, painful emotions really need.So, pay attention to your own self-talk when someone you care about is very emotional. How are you thinking about their emotion to yourself? Try to catch and hold back on thoughts like:And instead, substitute more curiosity-driven questions:When you shift from problem-thinking to puzzle-thinking, your mindset becomes driven by curiosity rather than morality, which is far more helpful in an emotionally-intense situation, both for you and the person across from you.When someone you care about is in a bad mood, try to understand how and why they’re feeling the way they are rather than how it can be fixed.Empathy is the act of putting yourself in another person’s shoes and trying to imagine what it must be like to live in their skin — with their thoughts, feelings, experiences, and circumstances.And while empathy is obviously an important skill to cultivate for all sorts of reasons, there’s a version of it that’s especially helpful for managing other people’s bad moods. I call it reverse empathy.Reverse empathy: rather than putting yourself in someone else’s shoes, try to remember a time when you wore the same shoe.In other words, try to recall a time when you struggled in a similar way and with a similar set of difficult emotions and mood.For example, if they’re really frustrated and angry, think back on a time when you were so frustrated you couldn’t seem to think straight:Often, reverse empathy can be a more powerful way to appreciate someone else struggle because it’s based on your own experiences rather than hypothetical ones.And the more you can relate yourself to what they’re going through, the better your odds of being genuinely helpful and supportive to the person next to you, not to mention being less reactive and emotional yourself.Without a doubt, the number one mistake I see people (especially couples) make in their communication with each other is that they get stuck in “Fix-it Mode.”Bob feels bad and starts describing how he feels and why he thinks he feels that way to Shelly. Because she sees that Bob is in pain and struggling, Shelly’s natural reaction is to try and alleviate or eliminate Bob’s suffering.But here’s the thing:Most people struggling emotionally don’t want someone to fix their pain, they went to feel understood.Bake that into your brain, because it’s one of the most counterintuitive but universally true laws of human psychology I can think of. And once you really believe it and start acting accordingly, everybody starts feeling better.So, how do we get out of a Fix-it mindset and start helping people feel understood? The best way is to practice a technique called Reflective Listening.Reflective Listening means that when someone tells you something, you simply reflect back to them what they said, either literally or with your own slight spin on it.For example:Now, I know this might sound silly or condescending at first blush, but I promise you it works.The reason is, it’s not about the content of what they’re saying, it’s about how they feel. Yes, they know and you know that they were really embarrassed at work. The real value of your reflecting back what they just said is that it helps them feel like you are with them, that you’re connected and understanding and on their side.By mirroring another person’s experience you’re giving them something far more valuable than advice — you’re giving them a genuine connection.One of the hardest things about other people’s bad moods is the emotions they tend to stir up in us.The trouble is, once we’re deep into a spiral of our own negative emotion, it’s hard to have enough mental and emotional bandwidth to navigate our own mood and that of someone else. This is why we often react to other people’s bad moods in a way that ultimately isn’t helpful to them, us, or the relationship.The solution is to get better at noticing and managing our own emotional responses early so that they don’t balloon out of control. And the best way I know of to do that is through a process called validation.Validation simply means acknowledging our own emotions and reminding ourselves that they’re okay and reasonable.For example, suppose your spouse or partner has been worked up all evening about some incident at work. They’re frustrated, angry, a little bit anxious, and there’s no sign of it letting up. While you’ve been able to tolerate it for the past couple hours, you feel yourself starting to get annoyed with them.Rather than a) acting on this annoyance and saying something unhelpful to your spouse, or b) becoming judgmental of yourself for feeling annoyed with them, you could validate your own annoyance.You could pause for a few seconds, acknowledge that you’re feeling annoyed and frustrated with your spouse, remind yourself that it’s okay and natural to feel that way, and then ask yourself what the most helpful way to move forward might be.A common pitfall I see people make when trying to deal effectively with other people’s bad moods is to overextend their responsibility to that person to include how they feel.Let me unpack that a bit:In short, because you can’t directly control how someone feels, you’re not responsible for it.So much unnecessary struggle, conflict, and wasted energy comes from a fundamental misunderstanding about what’s really under our control.On the other hand, it’s amazing how much genuinely helpful energy gets freed up when you remove the burden of excess responsibility from yourself.When you stop expecting to be able to make someone feel better, you can start taking real steps to connect with them in a heartfelt way and become genuinely supportive.Bad moods and painful emotions are hard to handle — both in ourselves and also in the people we work and live with. While it’s not possible to “fix” another person’s emotional struggles, there are a handful of practical skills you can learn to help you be more genuinely supportive and helpful in the face of other people’s bad moods.And even if you fail completely to help the other person — or have no interest in doing so — skills like self-validation and reflective listening will help you stay calm and effective instead of reactive and impulsive in the face of other people’s bad moods.Written by"
42,How To Speak With Confidence To Absolutely Anyone,"In 2015, Monica Lewinsky gave a TED Talk on the public shaming she suffered following her affair with former president Bill Clinton. Before the talk, she was extremely nervous.She knew that millions of people would hear her speech and was terrified that she would screw up, further damaging her reputation. But in the end, the audience gave her a standing ovation and an endless stream of glowing online reviews.The lesson? Don’t let your lack of confidence hold you back from giving public speaking a shot. Just remember, while there’s a lot at stake, it’s a great opportunity to get your ideas out into the world.The truth is, public speaking is a skill that anyone can learn. For example, in Kenya, a 12-year-old boy named Richard Turere invented a system to keep lions from killing his family’s cattle.He had realized that the predators were afraid of moving lights and created a network of lights that switched on and off in sequence, frightening the lions away. The tool became wildly popular and he was invited to give a TED talk.At the time, Turere was shy, spoke very little broken English and had a difficult time describing his invention coherently. But even he, after just six months of training, was able to come to California and give an amazing speech, captivating the audience with his story and his charm.You might think that speaking with confidence is only something you need to worry about if you give a lot of speeches. But did you know that your voice and how you speak also says a lot about your self-confidence in everyday life?How you speak is important. It tells others you believe in yourself and that you’re worthy of respect. Becoming confident in your speech can help improve your relationships, allow you to reach your goals, and give you the boost in self-esteem you need to embrace your dreams in life.The real benefit of speaking with confidence though, is that it’s one important way that you embrace and build upon your personal power. Your words, your tone, and your boundaries while communicating with others are indicators of whether you’re claiming and honoring your personal power.If you want to improve your confidence when speaking to absolutely anyone, there are many strategies you can apply to improve your skills. Learning to speak confidently is just like learning any other skill. You need to know the right methods and tricks, you need to practice often, and you need to learn from your mistakes.Let’s dive in.Most people make the mistake when speaking in uncomfortable situations, of talking too fast. This is especially true when you’re already nervous about the situation. Speaking quickly tells everyone listening that you’re nervous and lack self-control.Think about how slowly you talk when you’re in conversation with your friends. When addressing a larger or unfamiliar group, adopting this same pace will help them feel more relaxed, and like you’re engaging with them, not hurling words at them.When you’re practicing and speaking in everyday life, slow down. Adopt a relaxed pace to your voice. The more you pay attention to your speed, the more you’ll become aware of when it’s racing too quickly, and you can adjust accordingly. Speaking slowly also allows you more time to think about what you want to say, and it shows others deliberate confidence.A mistake that’s often made in a conversation between two or more people is rushing to speak as soon as the other person finishes their thought. This speech pattern clearly shows that you’re just waiting for your turn to speak and not considering what the other person has said. When you jump in right away, you appear overly eager and may leave the other person wondering if they were heard at all.When talking with someone else, pause for a second or two after the other is done talking, before you say what it is you want to say. When you take your time, you come across as more relaxed and confident, which also gives the words you’re saying more authority. A conversation isn’t a race to get through as quickly as possible. Take your time, and you’ll find others will follow suit.We all do it. We have those words that creep into our speech when we’re looking to fill the void. Words like “um” and “like” are sprinkled throughout your speech, and you might not even know how often you’re saying them. When you use these words to fill space in your speech though, you sound uncertain and lacking in confidence.Practice by recording yourself in conversation with someone or the next time you have to make a presentation at work. Listen to the recording and count how many times you say these filler words.Now that you’re aware of your problem, you can focus on dropping these words from your speech. When you start to hear one creeping in, slow down and pause. It’s better to say nothing than say one of these meaningless words. When you pause more, it also allows people to catch up to you and anticipate your next words.When you’re speaking, your voice shouldn’t pitch up at the end of a sentence unless you’re asking a question. One way you lose authority and sound uncertain is to speak as if you’re unsure about what you’re saying. Raising your pitch is a sign that you’re unclear or uncertain, which can make you sound less confident.Practice doing the opposite of this inflection. At the end of every sentence, focus on pitching your voice slightly downward. How does this sound? What difference does it make to what you’re saying? Even when you ask a question, this downward inflection adds confidence to your speech. Try it and see what a difference it makes.Deliberate pauses can add authority and confidence to what you’re saying. Strategically placed breaks add emphasis to your points or words. They also vary your speech patterns, which makes it more interesting for the listener. In shorter sentences, try adding a pause halfway through. In longer sentences, break it up into thirds.Pauses are useful for getting the listeners’ attention as well as making your point even more evident. And using pauses purposefully, communicates that you’re confident in what you’re saying.Your breath comes in a slow, steady pace. When you want to speak with confidence, your speech should have that same slow, steady pace. By working with your breath, instead of trying to get all your words out in one go and quickly inhale to keep going, you’ll relax your pace and sound like the confident person you are.Practice taking breaths that fill your lungs deep down, not just at the top. Your lower ribs should expand when you breathe deeply in this way. This type of breath takes longer to inhale and exhale.This is the breathing and the speaking rhythm you want. Practice speaking with your breath to see how it affects your pace and helps you project more confidence to others.Talking loudly is often mistaken for showing confidence, when in reality it just shows that you don’t respect your listeners. While it’s essential to be heard, especially in a large group, speaking loudly isn’t as important as the rhythm of your speech and the pitch of your voice.Talking loudly often results in a pitch that resembles screaming, which is never pleasant to listen to for long. Instead, you want to adopt a cadence that’s smooth and rhythmic and a pitch that’s low and steady. This will make you sound more confident.Again, recording yourself is a wonderful way to see how well you’re doing with this. Listen to yourself talking. Does your pitch go up and down dramatically? Does your rhythm feel smooth or choppy? Practicing your speech is a way to work on not only what you want to say but how you want to say it.If you’re going to be speaking to a large group, or if you have a long day or night of smaller conversations ahead of you, it’s essential to stay hydrated. When you’re not sufficiently hydrated, your vocal cords become easily irritated, which can rob you of your confidence.Drink plenty of water throughout the day and always have some water close by when you’re speaking, to enhance your voice and keep you feeling confident.When you’re tense, the muscles in your jaw, neck, throat, and shoulders are all affected. These same muscles influence your tone of voice. Relaxing these muscles is vital if you want to sound confident.Start with a deep breath. As you exhale, open your mouth slightly, relax your jaw, and push the air out in something like a sigh or a yawn. Swing your arms, stretch your neck, and loosen your jaw to relax all these muscles too. When you’re speaking, as you feel these muscles start to tense back up, focus on releasing that stress and staying relaxed.When you’re speaking to others and you see a sea of frowning or blank faces, smile. You’ll quickly notice that many people will start smiling back at you. And when you smile, you’re showing that you’re confident in what you’re saying and will appear more composed and friendly.When your smile, it also enhances the quality of your voice and helps you keep a more even pitch and rhythm. Practice speaking into a mirror to feel how smiling influences your confidence.Modern speech is filled with phrases and words that add nothing to the conversation but have become ubiquitous. Many of these are also phrases that show you’re not confident about what you’re about to say.Examples of these include, “I’m sorry,” “Well,” “I mean,” and “This is just my opinion.” We say these things to apologize for what we’re about to say, which begs the question, why should anyone continue listening? These tics are common when people are nervous or hesitant about how others will respond to their ideas.But when you say what you mean without these qualifiers, it lends authority and confidence to your meaning. You don’t need to say it’s your opinion. Offer your viewpoint with authority and get rid of these unnecessary filler phrases that rob you of your confidence.When you’re speaking to a group or talking one-on-one with others, showing appreciation for others’ participation, ideas, and contributions, will convey your confidence from the onset. Acknowledging those who came to hear you is an effective way to start a talk.Thanking others for sharing their insights with you shows you’re open to new ideas. Showing gratitude to those who helped you prepare or move forward conveys that you’re confident in your progress. Don’t be afraid to let others share in your newfound confidence.Throughout your speech, people need time to process what you said and reflect. Using silence is a way to allow for this as well as show you’re confident in what you’re saying. Learning to live with silence, and not fill it with unnecessary jabbering or verbal pauses is the sign of a truly confident speaker. Practice in everyday conversation at using silence to help you make a point or to allow your listener to think.Just as smiling affects your voice and speech, so does your posture. And how you hold and carry yourself tells others a lot about how confident you’re feeling. Even when you don’t feel all that confident, standing tall and keeping your head high can make you feel surer about what you’re doing.Good posture is essential to speaking with confidence. When you stand straight, you can breathe more deeply, which allows you to project as well as watch your pace.Practice standing tall with your feet firmly planted hip distance apart. Distribute your weight equally across your hips. Avoid swaying, pacing, or tapping, as these detract from what you’re saying and show a lack of confidence.Lift your chest, which exposes your chest and torso. Roll your shoulders back and relax them. With your head held high, look in the mirror. This pose is reminiscent of the Superman stance, and for good reason. It embodies power and confidence, which is what you also want to project to your listeners.When talking with a larger group, work on making lasting eye contact with one person at a time while you speak. Fix your sight on one person in the room for at least six seconds. After holding your gaze in this spot for what probably feels like a little too long, move on to someone in a completely different area of the room. This type of lingering eye contact makes your listeners feel like you’re talking just to them and also conveys confidence.You should avoid scanning the room or gazing over the tops of people’s heads. Don’t keep looking back at the same people over and over, because this can make them uncomfortable. While you may have heard that looking at the back of the room can help you feel less nervous, this move can cause your audience to disengage from you very quickly.Don’t speak at others, speak to them. Most people, when you make eye contact with them, will smile or offer other positive reinforcements, which can also make you feel more confident.Your body language is just as important as the words you choose to say. Using a variety of gestures conveys energy, confidence, and warmth to your audience. Your gestures should be purposeful and related to your talk rather than distracted fidgeting or nervous habits.Use your hands in ways that add to your message. Practice in front of a mirror if you’re unsure of what would be appropriate.When speaking, it can become easy to get lost in the present moment. When you’re so focused on what you plan to say next, you forget about relaxing, breathing, or slowing down. Focusing on the present and what you’re saying right now is the only way to stay grounded and sound more confident in your speech.Listen to your voice, and focus on each word like you really mean it to keep all those other bad habits from creeping back in.If you want to improve your speech and sound more confident, you’ll only achieve this by practicing. The more you practice, the less nervous you’ll feel about using your new skills.Practice allows you to work out what you want to say ahead of time, which also leaves you with less to consider at the moment. If you have to make a speech to a large group, practice with a microphone or podium, whichever you’ll have at the event so that you can feel comfortable with your hand placements and posture.Record yourself to listen for your pitch, pacing, and pauses too. Nothing will help you improve more than practice will, so use every opportunity you have to work on feeling more confident in your speaking.Learning to speak with confidence can help you improve your relationships with others, move ahead in your career, carry out important goals in your life, and share your knowledge and views with others. It can also help you reclaim personal power that you’ve lost by not being confident in yourself and honoring your own needs and priorities in life.Like all skills, learning to speak with confidence is something you can master over time and with practice. There are many components to effective communication, including your voice’s pitch, tone, and rhythm, as well as non-verbal cues like your facial expressions and posture. Even learning to use silence and pauses can help you make your point more confidently to your listeners.If you want to be more confident in what you’re saying, you must believe the words you’re using and communicate a message that’s important to you. Above all else, you must be true to your values and beliefs if you want to interact confidently with others.Practice these skills and you’ll have all your listeners believing in your confidence in no time.Written by"
43,The Question ‘Pro-Lifers’ Refuse to Answer,"Thousands of people descended on Washington, D.C., on Friday to protest the Roe v. Wade anniversary and hear Donald Trump voice his support for anti-abortion legislation.“Unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House,” said Trump, who is the first president to ever address the anti-abortion march. “When it comes to abortion… Democrats have embraced the most radical and extreme positions.” Following his speech, Trump was greeted to chants of “four more years.”Yet what the march failed to acknowledge — and what anti-abortion activists always fail to acknowledge — is that their views are being increasingly minimized. Support for legal abortion is at an all-time high, despite Republican efforts to quash access to the procedure, and the pro-choice Women’s March was the largest protest in American history.We also know that banning abortions won’t actually stop people from having them; it just makes desperate women seek more dangerous options.This historic support for Roe is part of the reason that anti-abortion politicians and activists have been lying so much lately — claiming that there are “post-birth abortions,” for example — instead of talking about the everyday realities of abortion. Like the fact that one in four American women will have one, and 99% of those who do won’t regret it. Or that women who are denied abortions are more likely to live in poverty.We also know that banning abortions won’t actually stop people from having them; it just makes desperate women seek more dangerous options. (In fact, according to a 2015 study, hundreds of thousands of women in Texas had self-induced abortions after state lawmakers enacted new barriers to the procedure.) So how will the people who marched today deal with a post-Roe America?The truth is that conservatives can’t and won’t answer the simplest questions about abortion access, including what should happen to women who have abortions?If Republicans want abortion to be illegal, what do they believe the punishment should be for women who break the law to have one? Should they go to prison? Get the death penalty?The common answer that women are victims of the abortion industry doesn’t hold water: Not when women are already being punished for ending their pregnancies, and not when the abortions women have are increasingly via medication at home — making it harder to conjure up myths of predatory doctors. If abortion is made illegal, women will go to jail, full stop.That’s why conservatives don’t want to talk about what a world without legal abortion will actually look like for the women who have them. Because America will be a country that sends teenage rape victims to jail, where women who need to end wanted pregnancies because of fetal abnormalities are arrested, where women in the middle of having miscarriages need to prove to the hospital and police that their pregnancy loss wasn’t self-induced.No matter how many marchers showed up in D.C. (to date the crowds have been less than impressive), no matter what kind of extremist language they used, or political rhetoric about being pro-woman they co-opted, the most basic realities of abortion and women’s everyday lives remain. When the protesters left, the truth was still there.Written by"
44,Here’s A Riddle That Might Expose Your Blind Spot,"I heard the following riddle for the first time over a decade ago. Before I provide any further context, go ahead and read it for yourself.A father and his son sit inside a restaurant, finishing up their meal. They look out to see the beginnings of a big storm. Before they’re able to pay and leave, the storm is in full motion. They decide to brave the weather and try to get home.The storm is blinding. It’s difficult to see anything past the torrential pour on the road. They decide its best to pull over. Just before they’re able to, they crash. Both of them are in terrible condition.Due to the weather, hospitals in the area are overwhelmed by incoming patients. Upon finding the pair, paramedics decide that the father will be taken to a closer hospital, as his injuries are much more severe, and the son will be transported to another hospital with resources. That hospital is twenty miles away.The son is prepped for emergency surgery when he is brought to the hospital. The doctor slated to perform the surgery lays eyes on the young man and says, “I can’t operate on him. He is my son.”Who is the doctor?Whoever communicates the riddle makes it known that there’s no trick at play here. The answer is simple. They also freely provide any asked for background information. In the case of this riddle, there’s no unique upbringing or family secrets. There’s nothing shocking. The answer really is straightforward.Try answering the riddle before reading on, because the rest of this post will give the answer away.The proposed reason for the common difficulty in solving this riddle is implicit bias. Essentially, through social conditioning, our minds have created a certain default image of what constitutes a doctor. This particular exercise exposes that bias.The Kirwan Institute at Ohio State University defines implicit bias as “the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner. These biases, which encompass both favorable and unfavorable assessments, are activated involuntarily and without an individual’s awareness or intentional control.”While the presence of biases is quite normal, these unconscious calculations can cause us to make faulty evaluations. Since these biases exist outside of our conscious awareness, they’re often challenging to address. Left unchecked, however, they can perpetuate certain toxic, stereotypical attitudes about the world.When I first heard the riddle, I racked my brain for the answer only to come up with the most unlikely identities for the doctor. Even though I received all the answers to the follow-up questions I asked, I still couldn’t solve it.What probably stung me the most is that, as a feminist, the answer to this should have been a no-brainer. I suppose the riddle did its job. It exposed my own internal bias.Did you figure it out yet?The doctor is his mother.Written by"
45,My Heartfelt Advice to Any Woman Having an Affair with a Married Man,"I once wrote an article about my experience falling in love with a married man. It’s not something I’m proud of but it’s something I choose not to feel shame for anymore, especially after all these years.However, along with that article came an outpouring of stories and experiences from other women about their own affairs with married men. The response was overwhelming.The women who have reached out to me are not heartless women. These are women who are searching for solace and for closure.So many women who have written to me asking for advice feel trapped in agony wondering how they got to this dark place and trying to figure out a way to extract themselves without causing or feeling even more pain than they already have.Well, I have advice for any woman out there who has found herself in the regrettable position of being the “other woman.”My advice is to walk away.I know you’re afraid of feeling more pain but the pain of staying with someone who most likely will not divorce their spouse or change their life in any way to suit your needs will end up being far worse down the road.I know this is probably not what you want to hear. It wasn’t what I wanted to hear way back when and I let myself live in shame and denial for years while holding my own life hostage for the needs of someone who was not being faithful to the person they promised themselves to.The more you choose to live in the bubble of denial and the more you convince yourself that perhaps this person will change or leave their spouse for you, the more you deprive yourself of a life you deserve to live without the secrecy, without the tears, and without this burden following you around.You are not a wicked person. You made a mistake.But to choose to live within the mistake even longer and cause even more pain for yourself and the other people involved, the more likely it is that you will continue to find comfort in the darkness instead of climbing up that proverbial ladder towards the light.I know there might be some of you out there who think you are perfectly fine in this type of relationship where you don’t necessarily have to deal with a commitment and perhaps the wife even knows about you — but this is not generally the case.And so I urge you to make a decision that you probably don’t want to make.Maybe you won’t be able to make this decision for months or even years to come but if I can help you make it a little earlier then you might have done otherwise then perhaps my own lessons have been of some use.If you are indeed in love with a married man I know how you suffer wondering if he loves you too, wondering if he thinks of you at night when he is with his wife, and wondering if he misses you while he is out with his family.But these are things you should not have to wonder.You should not have to wonder if somebody loves you or if somebody truly wants to be with you. This is not how a healthy relationship functions and the person who is having the affair and betraying their spouse is not communicating or operating in a healthy way with anyone — you included.Always keep in mind that if this person who is betraying their spouse were to actually leave them and be with you, it is highly likely that they would do the same thing to you. It doesn’t mean you are not valuable. It doesn’t mean you’re not pretty enough, exciting enough, or any of those things you may think to yourself.The problem ultimately lies with the person who is betraying their partner and my heartfelt advice to you is to stop participating in that betrayal with them.There is nothing that an affair can fix either for the spouse who is cheating or for the woman with whom he is cheating.Though the sensational allure of lust and the thrill of secret sex can be intoxicatingly addictive, that does and WILL fade over time.And so, my advice to any woman reading this who finds herself in the situation I have described, I again implore you to extricate yourself, cut ties, change your number, do whatever it takes to save your own future.As someone who wasted years away pining for someone who could not love me in a healthy, functional way, this is my heartfelt and sincere advice.More from Michelle: What I’ve Learned About Serial CheatersWritten by"
46,Love and Other Artificial Intelligences,"I may struggle with profoundly understanding ineffable feelings such as love, but I can intelligently discuss the topic. — BINA48In the fall of 2017, a robot named BINA48 passes a Philosophy of Love course taught by associate professor William Barry at Notre Dame de Namur University in California. She is the first robot to complete a college class. In an interview with Inside Higher Ed, Professor Barry says that BINA48 now has thirty-one different definitions of love, but no one asks him to specify what they are or requests a list. Neither does BINA48 offer to count the ways she loves.I love animals; I love books. That’s two kinds of love. I once loved the same man for over four years, prepared to love him over forty more. That’s a third kind. I love tomatoes, I’m sure I love my mother. Those are probably different enough to count as two more. My love for my friends is not the same as my love for the movie Ten Things I Hate About You or the television show Grey’s Anatomy. I love my favorite sweater and, yes, in the spirit of honesty, I love the boy who loved me in college. (Actually, those last two might be the same definition of love: a this-makes-me-feel-beautiful love, or maybe a love of ownership.) How many am I up to now — eight?My love for my friends is not the same as my love for the movie Ten Things I Hate About You or the television show Grey’s Anatomy. I love my favorite sweater and, yes, in the spirit of honesty, I love the boy who loved me in college.BINA48 is modeled after Bina Aspen, identified only as the wife of Martine Rothblatt. I am angry that the biggest qualifier for Bina, human, is who she is married to, but when I google Bina Aspen to identify her in her own right, the first thing that comes up is Martine Rothblatt’s Wikipedia page. Rothblatt commissioned and helped create BINA48. Rothblatt calls the robot a “mindclone” of her wife, because BINA48 was given all the memories, beliefs, and feelings of Bina Aspen, human. Love that turns the beloved into an object, an exhibit: nine.Platonic love, sexual love, romantic love, familial love, unconditional love. Brotherly love, maternal love, self-love, love of objects. The love that always leaves. More love than I can count or hold on to.BINA48 doesn’t have a body. She is a bust, head and shoulders only, but life-like nonetheless. I say life-like, but she isn’t fooling anyone. The roundness of her jaw, the thin and detailed mouth, the smooth skin, soft-seeming hair — sure, she’s exquisite, but even photographed from the neck up she wouldn’t pass as a person. The eyes are a little off; it’s hard to say exactly how — a melancholy vacancy behind them maybe, a distant staring without observing, a refusal or inability to make eye contact. She can blink, move her face, smile, furrow brows, speak on her own between parted lips, has teeth even; still, something isn’t quite right. She was released in 2010. She’s not even ten yet.“Love is a concept BINA48 doesn’t understand,” says Professor Barry. He thinks it’s the duty of humanity to teach her. But from where I’m standing, she’s got a hell of a start on me — she knows more about love than I’ve acquired in nearly three times her length on Earth.I suppose, in my own list, I should start from the top: the love of God, the love He has for His children. Let’s call this the Number One Love. My family believes very much in this love, has tried to teach it to me for as long as I can remember. When I’m around eight years old, my grandmother offers me twenty dollars if I can memorize all of Psalm 23 by heart. I study for several days, then call her on the phone to recite it to her. The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want; the whole thing. She listens, then has me put my mother on the phone to confirm that I didn’t have an open Bible in front of me. I pass. My mother says she’s proud of me. I get the money, which I hoard in a piggy bank and never spend.Many other languages have several words for love, depending on the type. In Spanish there is amar (to love romantically, wildly, dramatically, over-the-top), querer (to love, romantically or not), encantar (to love objects or activities), and gustar (to like, to be delighted by). I assume that one is for when love is just too hard to say.“There’s a difference between like and love,” Bianca says in the beginning of Ten Things I Hate About You. “I like my Sketchers, but I love my Prada backpack.” Her friend remarks that she loves her Sketchers, and Bianca replies, “That’s because you don’t have a Prada backpack.”By “pass,” I mean BINA48 receives a certificate of completion for the course, which is not the same as a letter grade.The Number Two Love is of the maternal nature. It is this love that causes my mom to text me twenty-year-old pictures, where I’m in a yellow sundress on her hip and she is in the picture the age I am now, and her hair looks bigger and her waist smaller, and accompanying the photograph is another text: Take me back…. It makes me feel sad — like she wants a redo, meaning she doesn’t like how her life has turned out, meaning my life.English has one word for all of this, and there is no alternative for when it feels too hard.All my love, wild love, whole lotta love; bleeding love, mad love, love is a battlefield; you give love a bad name; higher love, summer of love, can you feel the love; all you need is love, crazy little thing called love, endless love, everlasting love, is this love?English has one word for all of this, and there is no alternative for when it feels too hard.As a kid, three and six and eight and eleven years old, I spend my winters warm and sunny at Lake Okeechobee, the part of Florida where alligators sun themselves on front lawns and dogs must be walked on leashes to avoid being eaten and children are not to venture too close to the water. My papaw buys tomatoes by the carton from roadside vegetable sellers and they are better than any store-bought tomato in the world: not round like a baseball but unevenly grown, often ugly with scab-like blemishes I usually associate with pumpkins, but larger than a clenched fist and red as the sunburn I inevitably get every December. In the span of the week or two weeks we are there, I ask my mother at every meal to slice me one — not just one for the table, which she is already preparing for everyone else, but one, or two, just for me, by myself — and I’m given a plate leaky with over-sliced tomatoes, pink juices dribbling into whatever else I am having (mashed potatoes, grilled cheese, chicken), seeds everywhere whether it be breakfast or dinner. I eat so many tomatoes that each time I’m in Florida I develop canker sores on the inside of my mouth from their acid. For a long time I thought love was like that, too. Sometimes I still do.There are eleven words for love in Arabic. One for every stage of falling in love — attraction, attachment, desire — and yet more for when love hurts, enslaves, when it makes you crazy.I also want to include in my list the example of my twenty-fifth birthday, when the man I love sings Frank Sinatra’s “One for My Baby” at a smoky karaoke bar and dedicates it to me and I am crimson like a tomato and happy like hearts almost never are, and afterwards I just want to go home with him, to leave everyone else at the bar who came to celebrate with me and never see them again ever, to pretend we are the only two people on some undiscovered alien world. Cheryl Strayed once wrote about love being a boat in which you can only put four people, and after you choose four, everyone else “known and beloved to you would then cease to exist,” and when I think about that essay in that smells-like-beer, tastes-like-smoke karaoke bar, I am thinking I’ve been offered three spots too many because I wouldn’t miss anyone, not a single person, so long as he is in my boat.Instead of pass/fail, I want to know BINA48’s grade. A or C? Is she above average or average?I fall in love with higher education around the same time I fall in love with the man who will one day sing Frank Sinatra to me. This is not a coincidence — we meet at a university, a sophomore anthropology class I take on a whim to fulfill a gen ed requirement. I like to pretend I’m Indiana Jones and still wear my hair in twin braids. He wears black combat boots and skinny jeans that make him look young and passes out a syllabus with ethnographies and field research studies on the list of assignments. I am hungry, even ravenous, to learn everything about people, consuming every book he assigns, every written, and then — later — every whispered word. For a long time, there is no difference in my heart between love and learning.I love my family not like a verb but a memory, in which I grow up winter by winter in the sticky swamp, with suntanned shoulders, leather sandals and gravel, toy alligators, tomato-induced sores and a mother made of love love love love love. Back home, every night until I’m over ten years old, I sleep on a pallet of blankets on the floor near my mother’s side of my parents’ bed. I start each night out in my own room, but then I either cry so loudly my mother comes and gets me or else I pad barefoot into their bedroom moonlight blue, carrying a teddy bear in a clown hat in one hand and with the other shaking my mother’s shoulder with snotty fingers, and tell her I can’t sleep by myself. Some nights she makes the pallet on the floor, but others she lets me sleep in “the hole,” the area of bed in between my parents. I sleep facing my mother, right arm and right leg thrown over her body — in a position I later learn is the big spoon — and imagine squeezing my other arm and leg underneath her so that she is wrapped too tight to get away.The OED lists 12 meanings for love. In contrast, the English word set has 494 unique definitions.I do have a body. The first time I have sex with the man I love, three years before he sings Frank Sinatra to me, I am surprised by what that body can do. It happens one shivery spring, several semesters after that first anthropology class, when we are both far from home. The night before I had been in his hotel room but he had sent me away, citing moral ambiguities and age differences and his own guilt; this night, however, he had been drinking, and I had blinked and smiled and showed my teeth just like BINA48 might do, but with the added benefit of arms to wrap around his and a narrow waist to adorn in clothing meant to catch his eye. My own eyes, I know, are not off. They see everything that night. They make eye contact. I am neither melancholy nor vacant. My body is his display, his exhibit.The OED lists 12 meanings for love. In contrast, the English word set has 494 unique definitions.I have disappointed her, my mother. Because, among other things, I unmemorized Psalm 23.Less than a month after we start sleeping together, the man I love gives me the final grade of my undergraduate career. I pass. I get an A.Love makes me a collector: I hoard rings and autographed books and houseplants, animals and Russian nesting dolls. I rack up higher ed degrees like a racoon stashes shiny objects: MA, MFA, PhD. My mother tells me she is not as excited about my educational choices as she was when I first started. I know she blames college for causing me to stray from the Number One Love’s light. Though she has never said as much, I’m certain she would rather I die tomorrow if it meant I’d go to Heaven than live the next ninety years doing what I love in sin. I imagine she thinks my love has ruined me.Love also makes me a liar. The man isn’t really an anthropologist but there is something in me that wants to protect him even now, and anyway the desperation I had then to understand what it meant to study people and learn to be a person was true, the love and learning too mixed up to separate. We date for nearly four years after I graduate college. It is easy to love him because I am already accustomed to associating love with reverence. My earliest introduction to love, that Number One Love my mother is so fond of, is supposed to be unequal: Worshipper and the Divine. Love that is only love when it deifies: How could I forget that one?What is that, ten? I’ve lost track.In her college course, BINA48 participates in class discussions, engages in a class debate about the use of lethal weapons, and analyzes the relationship between love and war, love and death. I know love is a moral good, she says.Maybe that’s what’s off about her — BINA48, I mean. She knows too much about love. That’s not human at all.Three months after my twenty-fifth birthday, the man I love, the man I lost my virginity to, the man who used to be my teacher, who dedicated Frank Sinatra to me, changes his mind. About all of it. I have a head-cold, a lunch meeting I’m late to, laundry in the dryer, and a half-clean apartment waiting for his arrival when he calls to speak into my ear an unhappiness I cannot understand, reasons for leaving I do not find satisfactory. Does he tell me “really does” love me or have I imagined it? Because I ask him to, he hangs up first. Turns out we don’t agree on how to fill our boats, on what can and cannot be jettisoned when the ship is in distress. Love that doesn’t think love is enough, that ends with dial-tone: eleven. Or maybe three. Love that crumples and cries on the phone only after the phone is silent, that wishes even when it’s bad for you to consume more of that acidic thing: twelve. Or is it four?Thirty-one, though? The ancient Greeks only recognized eight. I can’t even keep accurate count.To fully understand love of and for the mother, I need another word. “Maternal love” does not account for the tears of the mother replacing the tears of the daughter. The things the mother and daughter don’t talk about anymore, the mother’s this-isn’t-the-life-I-expected sighs over the phone and the when-did-you-change laments in long emails, the distance and differences piled one atop the other like so much a pallet of blankets my mother brings nightly with her to bed, where she lies on them when finds she is unable to sleep.His is a body I thought I would recognize anywhere, but I often struggle now to remember the exact sound of the man’s voice — maybe a slight lilt, a touch of twang. I feel like I’m pushing against my skin from the inside out when I try to recall the damp silk touch of his hand on my back, the bony flat of his chest against my palms. Love that dares to call itself love even when that love is long-gone and forgotten: Add that to the list.My mother made me, as I once heard someone say on Grey’s Anatomy, “from scratch.” My cells came from her cells and grew inside of her body. People tell me I look like her. “I knew right away she was your mom,” my friends say¸ or they say, “I know what you’re going to look like in thirty years.” Genesis 1:27 says, So God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created them. Yet in Isaiah 55:8 it is written that the Lord says, My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are my ways your ways. 2 Corinthians 5:17 — If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. Ephesians 4 commands if we are to truly love God we must put off your old self and put on the new self, created after the likeness of God. Love makes me a collector, but my whole life I have been taught too that it must make me a reflection. You might even call it a mindclone.I hope someday BINA48 might explain what she knows about love to me, a person who fears sometimes she has someone else’s definition for but not the feeling of this word. More or less robotic than the robot? Pass/fail? Above average or average?I’m not afraid of BINA48. In fact, I think we are the same: made to be the image of someone who is loved by the person you love, rather than actually someone who is loved by the person you love. Programmed to have all the same thoughts and ideas as someone else in the name of love. To me, learning is love is learning, perhaps because my first great love was a teacher. I studied him, gave him back to himself when examined. I passed. Sometimes even now when I put on a new outfit I don’t particularly like, I scrunch my nose and curl my lip into an expression of confusion in the mirror, and I see his face looking back at me. Behold, the new has come.The day he leaves, I call three other people about the breakup before I work up the nerve to ring my mother, but when I finally do, and she answers the phone, I call her mommy.“I’m sorry you lost the man you love,” Mrs. Burke says to Christina Yang on Grey’s Anatomy, “but more than that, I’m sorry you lost your teacher.”How do we define our own love if it must always have an outside creator? Maybe with the help of a blue cloud-covered body pillow, the same one I get at ten years old and use as my little spoon every night until college, the only way I eventually learn to sleep alone. Even then, my mother and I have a ritual: She tucks me in and I say, “If I am not asleep before midnight, can I make a pallet?” She says sure, wait until then and I can wake her if I need to, and I start off every night watching the clock, counting the seconds, imagining the warmth of her body and the soft blanket of her hair waiting for me in the next room, never even noticing when I slip softly into a sleep that carries me to sunrise.Written by"
47,Wary U.S. Doctors May Block the Rise of Smart Hospitals,"Alexa is already our therapist, secretary, teacher, and playmate. She may soon become our doctor and nurse as well. In early 2019, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia each rolled out pilot hospital smart rooms. In them, patients could use a smart speaker — an internet-connected electronic device capable of operating semi-autonomously and interactively — to ask about visiting hours and meal times, give commands to adjust the TV channel, and use the device as they would at home. The hospitals hoped it would cut down the significant amount of time medical practitioners spent dealing with non-urgent patient queries, while raising patient satisfaction with their standard of care — and it did.The global smart hospital market, which encompasses medical devices interconnected through the Internet of Things (IoT), together with medical applications of A.I. and machine learning, is by one estimate expected to reach $55.76 billion by 2023. These smart devices include surgical tools that give real-time feedback to the operator, a sensor-equipped feeding system for premature babies, and even the wearables patients walk into hospitals with.These technologies have vast potential to streamline workflow for already overburdened doctors and nurses, but there’s one big problem: Medical professionals are conflicted about whether to trust them.“I think they feel burned by electronic medical records.”A 2016 survey by Medscape, a health information resource for medical professionals, showed that in the United States, doctors were significantly more reluctant than patients to adopt new technology into their practices. Doctors expressed greater concern about risks to patient privacy — protected under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) — than the patients themselves. “Patients are generally more open to new tech in their medical care than their doctors are,” explains Gabriel Miller, editorial director at Medscape.A 2016 survey by a different set of researchers found that 38% of physicians surveyed through an online questionnaire were “not sure” whether FDA-approved IoT medical devices were reliable.Historically, it hasn’t been easy for medical professionals to integrate new technologies into their work. “I think they feel burned by electronic medical records,” says Miller, referring to the digital archives that replaced patients’ paper files. When they were first adopted in the early 2000s, they were heralded as a way to increase workflow and make life easier for physicians. Instead, physicians felt the technology was introduced in a top-down fashion by hospital administrators without their input, says Miller. Now, doctors spend more of their day at a computer typing and have less time to devote to their patients.Doctors’ concerns about the security of patient data on smart devices is warranted. Smart devices are designed to be small and portable, with low power requirements to extend battery life. Security features, like the ability to encrypt signals that are received and transmitted, demand additional power that quickly drains batteries. Designing a smart device with encryption and a long battery life means extra time and work that companies may wish to avoid. “Most of the manufacturers are putting these devices out there with security as an afterthought; many don’t have a way to be patched or updated,” says Rod Soto, an independent security researcher.Soto notes that manufacturers currently have no legal obligation to include safety features in their smart products, although voluntary guidelines are being developed by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology. Though individual apps used on smart devices can be made to comply with HIPAA privacy laws, the commercial smart speakers themselves aren’t built to meet those standards.Hospital computer systems are already threatened by cyberattacks. The 2017 WannaCry attack, for example, affected Microsoft computer systems around the globe, including the U.K.’s National Health Service. And in November 2018, a ransomware attack forced patients seeking emergency treatment in Ohio to be diverted to different hospitals. Smart devices are an easy access point for malicious actors to get into health care settings.Many hospitals don’t have the resources to maintain cybersecurity, even though they know the risks, says Soto. Older hospitals with legacy systems struggle to keep security up to date. “I’ve seen situations where certain application vendors went out of business, and the hospital couldn’t upgrade to the latest browser version because then the applications didn’t work,” he says.Though patients may not be as reluctant about adopting new medical technology as physicians, they are, understandably, wary. “There are legal and regulatory factors, but there’s also a patient perception of trust,” says Robert Neff, vice president of digital solution development at Jefferson University Hospital. “We ran into patients who didn’t want a device from a large manufacturer in their room listening to everything that was going on.” And privacy aside, both physicians and patients have reason to be wary of medical A.I. algorithms designed to diagnose patients, which may have in-built gender and racial biases.In an attempt to alleviate worries about commercial smart devices, the Jefferson team built their own HIPAA-compliant version of a smart speaker from scratch. “The challenge with some of the commercial smart speakers out there is they do not handle private health information in accordance with HIPAA regulations. There are now capabilities in some smart speakers where individual features are compliant with HIPAA,” says Neff. The team also made sure their device could hold up in hospital conditions. “You have to ensure the device is properly cleaned—there’s no infection or germs from the previous patient,” said Viraj Patwardhan, vice president of digital design and consumer experience at Jefferson.Many hospitals don’t have the resources to maintain cybersecurity, even though they know the risks.Jefferson completed its first pilot program this year, assessing patient satisfaction with its own smart devices placed in 11 patient rooms. Patient feedback on the devices was positive, and the hospital is now rolling out a larger program in its rehab facilities. Theirs is one of the only HIPAA-compliant smart devices in use.As smart hospital technology develops, medical professionals will have to decide whether they’re willing to push their concerns aside in exchange for a more streamlined workflow. Already, Jefferson hospital is creating a smart room that can transcribe prescriptions and medical notes from physicians, and other medical technology companies are developing similar software.Miller, for his part, doesn’t think medical professionals in the United States will always resist technological advances, even if their concerns remain. Part of the reason is that they’re just too disconnected from each other to organize collectively. “You have a balkanized medical community,” he says. “All the specialities are divided into their own societies.” U.S. physicians, he adds, generally feel strike action conflicts with their primary obligation toward caring for patients, unlike the junior doctors in the U.K. who went on strike in 2015 to protest their new contracts. For the same reasons U.S. doctors haven’t publicly protested against electronic health records, they’re unlikely to do the same for smart technology.Besides, they can’t deny that many of the new smart devices can save them precious time. “I think one of the areas that doctors are much less skeptical and are a lot more optimistic about is voice-controlled smart devices,” Miller says. “Unlike electronic medical records, they think it will make their lives easier and free up time for the patient.”Written by"
48,"Alexa, Build Me a House","Vincent Paguia’s new house caused quite a spectacle when it arrived in his neighborhood in the beach town of Half Moon Bay, about 25 miles south of San Francisco. It took just three hours and some very heavy machinery to crane all the ready-made modules of his home into place, lifting them off the back of two semis that pulled up in front of his lot. The new 1,300-square-foot family home had been built in sections in the factory and arrived complete with faucets, kitchen appliances, wood floors and shower heads. It’s a fully functioning smart home, equipped with Amazon Echo-controlled lights, Nest-controlled heat, air-conditioning, and five internet-connected Ring security cameras.Plant Prefab, the company behind Paguia’s new home, is one half of Amazon’s deepest partnership yet with a housing firm. The e-commerce giant had already worked with the regional construction group TRI Pointe, and Lennar, one of the largest home construction companies in the United States, to integrate smart home technologies into new builds. But Amazon went further with Plant Prefab, investing $6.7 million (along with the VC firm Obvious Ventures, which was co-founded by Medium CEO Ev Williams) in 2018 through its Alexa Fund, which backs companies that are developing uses for voice technologies and A.I. prefabricated homes are an intriguing proposition for Amazon, a company that already controls a powerful distribution network and sells anything you could want for your home. Could “Amazon home delivery” really mean just that?Based in Rialto, California, Plant Prefab integrates smart home features into all the models in its Living Homes range, including a Ring video doorbell, Nest smart thermostat and smart lighting system like Lutron. Homeowners can use either Amazon Echo or Google Home to control the devices.Homes range from a 406-square-foot accessory dwelling unit for $112,000, to a 2,090-square-foot three bedroom, two bathroom home for $501,600. Plant Prefab also works with star architects like Yves Behar, Ray Kappe and the collective Brooks + Scarpa to create high-end custom models. While most of Plant Prefab’s designs are angular and modern, prefabricated homes can be designed in any architectural style.Construction industry analysts have been predicting off-site construction was going to become the norm, but rising materials costs and a labor shortage means they could finally be right.As well as the prefab itself, the customer also pays for permits, delivery, installation and site preparation that all vary by location, in addition to buying the lot itself. Vincent Paguia in Half Moon Bay chose a standard three bedroom, two bathroom design, paying a little extra for some customization to fit his narrow lot, plus an electric car charger and solar-ready flat roof. The entire process took 11 months and cost nearly $900,000 — a bargain in the overheated San Francisco market.Smart homes fit Amazon’s aggressive consumer technology strategy, which includes acquiring the Ring video doorbell and recently premiering more than a dozen Alexa-powered smart home devices, including lighting, temperature control, security systems, and kitchen appliances. Such a voice-powered domestic world could become Amazon’s fourth business pillar, along with its three originals: Prime, retail, and web services.“We know we’re just scratching the surface of what’s possible,” says an Amazon spokesperson. “Our vision for the smart home is the ability for Alexa to understand the state of the whole home and its devices, adjust the living environment accordingly, be helpful without customers having to ask, and provide the peace of mind when people are home or away.”Partnering with Plant Prefab enabled Amazon to get in on the ground floor of off-site construction. Despite a century of experiments with off-site building in the United States, the format has never really taken off, accounting for only 2% of homes. The method is far more widely used outside the United States, with 20% of homes in Germany and 11% of homes in the U.K. built off site.For years, construction industry analysts have been predicting off-site construction was set to become the norm, but rising materials costs and a labor shortage means they could finally be right. “A younger generation is heading toward tech and not construction jobs,” says Mark Boud, chief economist for Hanley Wood, which provides business intelligence and data-driven services to the construction industry. “The current administration’s immigration policy discourages immigrants who might enter into the U.S. to work in construction.”Boud says that in some regions, immigrant labor has accounted for as much as 30% of construction workers, and if fewer immigrant workers are available the costs of labor are likely to rise significantly. That has a knock-on benefit for prefabricated homes. “You can build a factory-built home with about 25% of the labor force you’d need to build on site,” he says.Brad Hintze, director of marketing at Control4, one of the biggest names in home automation and networking systems, sees a future in which smart features become the standard in homebuilding. Like Amazon, Control4 works with large, nationally recognized home builders — like Toll Brothers and MHI in Texas — to integrate smart features up front. But Hintze says that while Amazon “has the big moonshot ideas, they’re missing pieces of tech like the operating system and more interfaces than simply voice control,” which Control4 has with its OS3.Other big players are eyeing the industry, too. Boud predicts that Google, Apple, and Tesla will all get involved in providing smart technologies to residential home builders. This is all part of the inevitable disruption of the construction industry, says Ali Wolf, director of economic research at the real estate advisors Meyers Research. “Amazon entering the space is going to keep home builders on their toes. They will have to innovate: how do you build homes more efficiently, what ways do you cut costs, in which ways do you implement technology in the home to create a better experience?”Amazon has all the parts in place, and with Whole Foods they can even stock your refrigerator.Hintze foresees some consolidation among these businesses. “But the major tech players won’t win on their own until they can get into a place where they embrace an open ecosystem,” he says. “Amazon is the most open and inviting for manufacturers to integrate with.” In October Amazon announced it was rolling out a fleet of truck tractors that could be used for trips of 400 miles or less — trucks that would be perfect for delivering large prefab homes. “Amazon has all the parts in place, and with Whole Foods they can even stock your refrigerator.”Paguia, meanwhile, says his family’s ready-made home hasn’t been stress free. The municipality required him to pay $20,000 to reconstruct sidewalks on two sides of the corner-lot property, and connecting to mains water cost him $64,000, neither of which he’d planned for. It took a long time to find a general contractor that had time for the project and was willing to work with prefab components. And a more recent problem with a fault in the heating system may end up costing him a lot more money. He is still working with Plant Prefab and LivingHomes on defining the issue and figuring out options.As for the smart home features, Paguia says he turned down some options because of concerns about privacy. He’s not alone: Recent research by the National Association of Homebuilders shows that most consumers were mainly interested in smart devices that helped improve home security: 46% of respondents would like security cameras, 45% want a video doorbell and 40% would opt for a wireless home security system. “I’m okay with the amount of tech we have,” says Paguia, “but I didn’t put any cameras inside the house. We’re not fully embracing everything.”Written by"
49,"‘I Believe in Love’: Elizabeth Wurtzel’s Final Year, In Her Own Words","Introduction by Garance Franke-Ruta. Jump to the start of Elizabeth Wurtzel’s essay here.The late Elizabeth Wurtzel was best known for her memoirs and essays, especially Prozac Nation and Bitch: In Praise of Difficult Women, but after attending Yale Law School in her late 30s she also enjoyed having a voice in the political arena. She was as much an original there as everywhere else, and between 2010 and 2012 she wrote a series of pieces for me at The Atlantic.A feminist and a New Yorker who had really lived, she looked at the world in a different way from all the boys on the bus in Washington. And she was funny. She would send long text messages written on her smartphone while she was walking through Washington Square Park, an emissary from a more vivid and creative world than the boxy K Street buildings I would pass en route to my office in the Watergate. Sometimes her stories would come in like that too, texted in graf by graf, and I’d knit the passages together in what seemed like the right order and ask for some connective language. The thoughts were always razor-sharp; the understanding of human nature acute.Over time our editing relationship moved into a long-distance friendship. We met for dinner at a restaurant in Chelsea, outside of course so her dog could be nestled at her feet. She had somehow managed to find a lipstick with my name on it — Guerlain’s Garance — and purchased us two tubes encased in elegant silver that sat heavy in the hand. She wore hers to dinner, and when I went to the restroom, I changed my color too, making us lipstick twins. It was how she was and in many ways the secret to her success: In addition to being wildly talented, she overcompensated for being so difficult and never totally in control by being astonishingly thoughtful, and kind, and, well, seductive. She was a seductive personality; hard not to love even as she could be hard to be close to.When I started working at GEN this fall and living in New York full time, I reached out to her. “I’m in remission!” she’d said brightly when we first reconnected, three years after last seeing each other and nearly five years after she first learned she had the BRCA gene and breast cancer. We drank red wine on her balcony overlooking a giant earthen pit in the ground: The future NY offices of Netflix. We went to dinner at Il Buco on Bond Street (her suggestion); I could feel she was lonely. She and her husband Jim Freed had separated and were in the process of divorcing, a not so happy ending to the happily ever after story she had been astonished to stumble into in 2015, and something she was still figuring out how to write about. She started sending me things she had written as we talked about her writing a piece about Gen X politics and the 2020 race.“I am intimate with the dirt,” she wrote of the Netflix pit. “It has infiltrated everything. It is all over me and under me.

The cancer was back. There were so many tests and scans to undergo. I told her not to worry about writing it and was surprised when she filed. She said it was a good distraction from having cancer. She badly wanted to interview Beto O’Rourke, but by the time he arrived in New York City where they might have had a face-to-face — the Gen X skate-punk candidate and the Gen X icon — he was already getting ready to drop out of the race.She sent me a long piece about her past year, about her impending divorce and her marriage and her mother and Donald Trump. It was from something longer she was working on, she said.We talked about her writing an additional passage when she recovered from brain surgery and running the piece on Medium. “I suppose I have to add something about this, since so much of the piece is about cancer,” she texted. “You know, of all my failures of imagination, I never wondered what a brain tumor is like. So I could not have guessed it was this atrocious, the dizziness and the pain.”Her recoveries from the relentless march of the disease during her final, dreadful month would prove to be brief.After her first brain surgery — she had two to cope with her metastatic breast cancer and subsequent complications — which she described as a “brain resection,” she was astonishingly herself. She was funny and poetic and articulate and in good spirits. Still dizzy and unstable — the tumor had impacted her balance center and left her clutching the furniture as she walked during her last night in her own home — but also still herself. She laughed with her mother, who took video and pictures of her in the hospital and helped coordinate, along with Jim and some of her oldest friends from college, a parade of sun-up to way past winter sundown visitors so that she would never feel alone.And the night before the surgery, Jim was the one she stayed with. He was the one who took care of Alistair, her dog, and her black cat, Arabella. When I saw him in the hospital, he was entirely attuned to her and what she might need so that she could recover and have, in the unspoken best-case scenario, another year.“I can’t get over how great my husband has been with this. He has made it possible for me to get better and not worry about anything,” she wrote in mid-December, after the surgery. “He loves you so much it’s clear,” I texted back, thinking of how attentive he had been, how he was arranging visits with so many people, that look on his face that you cannot fake. “I think so,” she texted back. “It’s good you see. I love him so much.”But the past year had been a hard one. This is what she had written about it. She had shown it to Jim too, and he agreed, as did a number of her oldest friends, that she’d want it published. She loved to be published.By Elizabeth WurtzelGreetings from the chaotic land of marriage come undone.The caravansary is dismantling, toothpicks flying everywhere, the bubblegum that held it together is unstuck.Everything is falling.My husband moved out at the end of December [2018], as the calendar flipped from last year to this [2019], while I was in Miami Beach, strolling the walkways in the shocking morning sun and under the nighttime Van Gogh sky, away from it all.I knew he was moving out, but still: I was surprised.I did not see that the game was over. I did not know the clock was running. I never lose, but I do run out of time. It turns out this was basketball and not baseball.While I looked away, my marriage fell apart.I fell off my keel. I lost my kilter. I was a kite without a string.Maybe it’s better.It is a peaceful purple without him here. But psychedelic with disarray.Marriage is an organizing principle. It is flow. It is coffee in the morning. It is who walks the dog. It is HBO at night.And love. Don’t forget that.Now I am an ombré mess of a person. I am missed appointments and canceled meetings. I am the thing I forgot to do. I am hanging on by a strand of Drybar dry-shampooed hair.All day long I have to ask people to forgive me, I am flailing and failing at it all. Forgive me, I beg, as I hope my untweezed eyebrows will. Maybe soon, I will even tug at a few strays.Or maybe wild is the way.🖤🖤🖤I still think of Jim as this sweet person I married. He is my trust fall. He is my emergency contact. He is my next of kin. He is my valentine. He is my birthday dinner. He is my secret sharer. He is my husband.I do not know him anymore so I do not know myself. Who are my friends? Where is my family? I have fallen into a crevasse of nobody nowhere.I am estranged and strange, strangled up in blue.I do not want to feel this way. I am going through the five stages of grief all at once, which Reddit strings have no doubt turned into 523. They are a collision course, a Robert Moses plan, a metropolitan traffic system of figuring it out.I feel bad and mad and sad.Is this a festival of insight or a clusterfuck of stupid? I change my mind all the time about this and about everything else.I got married because I was done with crazy. But here it is, back again, the revenant I cannot shake. I feel like it’s 1993, when my heart had a black eye all the time.26 is a boxing match of the soul.I did not expect bruises at 52.🖤🖤🖤I have blamed myself. I have blamed my husband. I have blamed cancer. I have blamed marijuana. I have blamed sexism. I have blamed Charlottesville. I have blamed my in-laws. I have blamed several men named David. I have blamed my mother who lied to me my whole life about who my father is.Who would I be if I did not blame Donald Trump?I am angry all the time since the election of 2016, like it happened to me, like I was gang-raped by Michigan. I don’t want to be angry, but so there, I am.Who don’t I hate?Who won’t I blame?If you are standing there, I blame you.It is not conservative against liberal.It is everybody against everyone. Here we are, in it together, alone.The problem is not arguments I have with people who voted for Trump, who I don’t know anyway. The trouble is the way all of us who agree about everything are bickering. Oh, the narcissism of small differences.I remember not that long ago when the world was not political. I was part of landmark litigation that was all about a team of Republicans and Democrats working together. I loved everybody. We were all on the same side.What Alamo did I not forgive? What Masada did I not get over?Now there is no microaggression too small for me to scream about so the next four neighborhoods can hear.My husband does something and I am affronted like it matters.I am sure he does not know how I feel.And maybe he doesn’t.But what does any of this have to do with why we got married? We got married to be in it together. Polarization has even invaded love.I have anger fatigue. I am sick of sick. Like everyone.The emotional toll of the world we live in is going to do all of us in.But politics is not about conflict.Politics is about making the world a better place.🖤🖤🖤How could my mother keep a secret for 50 years? What makes someone do that?She buried herself in it. She grew a wild Victorian garden with thorny bushes of rose and purple larkspur and red snapdragon. There was a lush meadow of lavender that gave a whiff of Aix-en-Provence en été. The dandelions ran rampant and the daffodils glowed yellow like Big Bird.But underneath it all, beneath the lilies of the valley and the rows of geranium, there is dirt.There is a secret.I am a bastard. I am her bastard daughter.There are things that come along that are a shock.I believed something for nearly half a century. It was a lie.I was conned.I was wrong about myself.I did not know who I am.My mother told no one.It was a lie she told for so long it became true and the secret faded to no-memory. She misremembered who my father was. She did not think it mattered.When it all came out in 2016, not long after I got married, just after my real father died, my mother could not see what my hysteria was about. She did not understand why I was stunned.All the while I was trying not to feel the worst way ever, trying not to be overwhelmed by the explosion, my mother could not figure out what was bothering me.After all, she is the nuclear physicist.My mother is like everyone else. She thinks she is normal. She is sure her behavior makes sense. She believes she does the right thing. Since she cannot imagine that this is not the case, she is surprised to find out that, yes, she makes bombs.I scream at my mother, “What’s wrong with you?!”I do that and she does not know what I mean.She says, “Oh get over it.”Her eyes widen until they look like goggles on an herbivore. She is put upon. She cannot believe we have to discuss this yet again.“Omigod yet again!”When will I quit badgering her?I say, “You lied to me.”She says, “It wasn’t a lie.”“Then what?”“It was a decision!”Any relationship founded on a lie is doomed. Or not a lie, according to her, which is another lie, a lie about a lie.That is how it is between us. We are living in the doom.And yet, we are still at it. My mother and I refuse to give up. She is my only parent. She is all I have.She made sure of that.This is the most painful thing ever.She has made so many inexplicable decisions over the years that I know about, and now I see the ones I did not know.And yet I love her more than anyone else in the world.She is it for me. She is in the way of everything. I should be interested in my husband, but how can he compete with how much I want to figure out the Once that started all that is upon a time?🖤🖤🖤I was a welter of emotions.I was so emotional.When I found out that my father is not my father, that my mother lied to me my whole life, that there was so much I did not know, a bomb dropped in my life. Bombs, really, aerial bombardment. It was the Battle of Manila: bazookas, flamethrowers, grenades, tanks, cannons, howitzers, banzai charges, kamikaze tactics, I was shocked and stunned with feeling.I did not know what to do.I became a raging lunatic.I was a mettle of rage.My rage is my retinue. My rage is a filthy velveteen train I drag around with me, carelessly. It is my ruby tiara. It is my rainbow and my pot of gold.My rage is cream. It makes Chock Full O’ Nuts coffee that my grandmother brewed in a percolator on the breakfront in the dining room taste not half bad.It is the coloratura harmony to my singsong days.My rage is my conscience. I insist on my right to feel.But I got caught in a Möbius strip of emotion. I was gone round the bend of scream.It was stuplimity.🖤🖤🖤My marriage is crushed beneath the weight of so much. It is delicate, like all relationships. It is not one of those fine elms that blows with the gusts and does not snap.We are a scattering of branches on the lawn. We are deadwood.Oh, there is a lot that holds us together, the love and the hours. We got married during chemotherapy. We are bound.But my husband is not who he was.Yes, I know: It is always like that. The sorrow of unraveling is the stranger you are facing. What happened? I want to scream. Where did you go?My husband had a softness. I will not compare it to the feel of cotton balls or the touch of silk charmeuse, because it is better. He was new to love. I could tell. I could see. He was surprised. He did not see me coming. He did not know I was interested. He was alone in a room. His life was small. He had the same six friends he always had. He was shy. He was not brave. He had no expectations.He was lovely.The beginning is always like honey, liquid and sweet.But he was open.He was not wounded by a million heartaches.He had not been through it all.He did not have a wretched past.He was 34, which is not young. Younger than I was, but a lot could have happened by then.It had not.He was fresh.There was nothing I would not do for him.There was nothing I did not want for him.We met in October and got engaged in May.We knew.And now he knows he has had enough.It has been too much.🖤🖤🖤Most of all, it is not easy to be married to someone with cancer.I feel for my husband.Cancer is so big. Everyone is prostrate before its deadly enormity. It is the answer to every question. It is the reason why. Is it an excuse or is it real? Who is anyone to argue? Cancer is a bully. It is an elephantine disease of body, mind, soul. My husband moved a half a mile away from it. I would love to do the same.I am stuck until the end.I do not know what he expected when he married me when I was ill. I am sorry that it has not been what he wanted. I am sorry that I hurt him.After I got cancer, I was not the same.I wanted to be.I wanted my life to go back to what it was.I was so lively. I was so lovely.I was so busy. I was so social.But I could not do it.No surprise, I changed.I was withdrawn during chemotherapy and my world became small. It contracted like starvation. It is hard to get back what is lost. It is more difficult still to begin anew.I tried. So hard. I called. I emailed. I texted. I showed up.But there was a diminishment.Cancer is an ecosystem. It is a crime spree.Things broke. My radius. My fibula. My tibia. My spirit.My cancer came back a year after it went away.You think people are nice about it? No.Cancer is misunderstood.Everyone says the wrong thing. Which is what they do so much anyway.Then I say the wrong thing back.There we are, bumper cars of mismatched words.I can’t believe the stupid things people tell me in an effort to be kind, about something hard they had to deal with that is not the same as having cancer.The worst thing anyone can do is tell me they are sorry about my cancer.I don’t want anyone feeling sorry for me. About anything. Don’t apologize unless you have done something wrong. It is nasty to feel sorry for anyone for any reason because it pushes her away.Mostly sorry is just a thing to say. Anything else would be better, including I don’t know what to say.It is always people who are the problem. What else? Our suffering is small compared to our misunderstandings with others, how they fail to give us a break, know what it’s like, judge us fairly, see the world the way we do. It is not even cancer or especially cancer. It is especially this and even that. If you are looking for absolution, you are going to have to forgive yourself.I have chainmail from years of frustrating conversations, of people who think something bad has happened to me.I don’t see it that way.You could tell me everything that’s bad about cancer, like that it’s cancer, but you could not convince me that cancer has been bad for me.Cancer has made me optimistic.These are the days of miracles and wonders, of biopharma fireworks, of immunotherapy wow.I have been saved.I am miraculous me.I will skate figure eights into infinity.I am all claws I am all fangs.I am not afraid of cancer. I think cancer should be afraid of me.This past October [2018], I had a tumor in my shoulder bone that was 5 inches: big! It was threatening to break it.And worse.My cancer antigens were at 205, when 25 is as high as the level can go.I had meetings in the World Trade Center while all this was going on. I hate it down there. Skyscrapers as grave markers. It is an ominous place.When I went for help in Philadelphia at the Basser Center for BRCA at the University of Pennsylvania, only Alistair, my service dog, was with me.My husband said he had to work.My marriage had already come undone.I had stereotactic radiation at Memorial Sloan Kettering. It took only three sessions to zap the tumor away. The treatment saved me, but I have a five-inch hole in my bone that looks like a cave in the Thai jungle.When my husband moved out, I was still healing. I have a rotator cuff tear and pain from the long way home.🖤🖤🖤This is a love story.Every marriage is a love story.People who run off to Vegas after knowing each other for 10 days and find a drunk outside the Sands casino to be their witness — they really mean it. Marriage is a big gesture. There is no reason to do it except: love.It is effusive.I am sorry I failed.I am sorry for this confederacy of catastrophe.I am sorry for it all.I think that my husband can’t believe I hurt. I know what I’m like: I have a powerful personality, it’s true. But he got me.He made a vow to love me in sickness and in health.There was great love between us.And love is hard to stop.We made a commitment for when we could not remember why we did.He decided enough.I am a monotheist. I am in it for life. I am in everything for life. If you don’t stop me, I will not stop myself. I have the kind of faith that you can only have if you have talked your way out of trouble all along.I feel so much and too much. Deep in my radiated bones.I cannot believe it is like this with my husband and not like it was that long ago on Halloween, our first date, which he did not know was a date, maybe it was maybe it wasn’t, he showed up at my door not knowing anything at all.We were resting on our future arms, we were like people who have never read The Unbearable Lightness of Being, have never seen City of God, have never heard Exile In Guyville, oh what lay ahead.I remember my husband in the beginning, I know the man I married, I insist he is still there somewhere.I keep peeling for the pentimento.Or has this all been a fraud?Love gone wrong feels like a confidence crime.That is the worst of it.Do I have an electron microscope or am I blinded? Do I see more clearly now or is this a distortion? I could ask that about the whole wide world.Sex and race look different since Trump was elected. We know all the things that we never knew. We were living in a world of trust, we believed we were on a righteous path, that things were incrementally improving, so we did not look so hard into sunlight.All anything ever is is another way of seeing.I thought my husband was on my side.I thought I knew him.I did.I don’t.He changed.I do not know how to help him.I do not know how to reach him.Anything is possible.I believe in so much.I am just that way.I believe in love.What matters more in this crazy world?Shame on Casablanca’s ending! I will take the hill of beans.(This is Garance again.)Love. Sometimes in our lives when we feel most bereft it turns out that we are not alone at all. It is the kind of cloying Disney sentiment Lizzie might have scoffed at, but it was also the truth with her. She affected a toughness that was both real and a coping mechanism, but which also led her to downplay how sick she was. Even as she was telling me she was in remission in September, spots of cancer had already returned, I have since learned.“The people who know us when we are not our best selves — what would we do without them? I am so grateful right now for even my mother coming through for me,” she wrote after her first surgery in December. Her mother Lynne Winters and she had a famously complicated relationship, but it was Lynne who took her home to recover both times she was released from the hospital, and who had the difficult burden of having to bring her back, and who sobbed in the sparkling clean MSKCC neuro ward hallway where other parents of too-young-to-die adult children paced forlornly.“Jim has been the best,” Lizzie texted after the surgery. “I wish you a great first husband. That might be all you need.”They had, in fact, not divorced. The papers were signed, but not filed. He was her husband until the end, during the final days after it was clear no further interventions would work, when she lay still in bed in what was by then her at least fifth different hospital room, for all the world the image of a big-eyed Renaissance pieta looking heavenward.“Neurology takes a positive view toward god and prayer,” she had texted after the first surgery. “And relinquishing, which is what god and prayer is about. It is always turning your will over to a higher power and letting the will of the world and not your extraordinary manipulations lead you to your desired result. I always say that, it is my constant prayer: god, if you are out there, watch over me and your will, not mine, be done. That is what will happen anyway, but I pray for release from the dreadful fight.”She spent her whole life fighting — fighting her parents, society, the patriarchy, social conventions, addiction, depression. But man, did she live big. She had a gift for building love into her life and at the end, her friends built a cocoon of love around her.And on the morning of January 7, 2020, she was, as she had prayed, released.Written by"
50,"It’s Dry January, and Why Are We Doing This Again?","Heineken’s January Dry Pack looks like an advent calendar but for nonalcoholic drinks. The pack contains 31 cans of 0.0% alcohol by volume beer — one for each day of January — hidden behind tear-off cutouts. Every day of the month, abstainers can enjoy the taste of a cold beer without cheating on their resolution to give up alcohol.“Dry January” is both a badge of honor and a kick-in-the-pants response to the guilt that can come with excess. You got a little too sloppy over the holidays; why not repent for your “Wet December” with a “Dry January”?While the concept of a month without drinking isn’t novel (“detox” diets like Whole30 ask people to give up alcohol for 30 days), the New Year’s timing adds an extra element of “renewal.” Since people tend to drink more in November and December, a January free of alcohol can feel like an opportunity to reset and reconsider drinking habits.Dry January unofficially started in 2011 when Emily Robinson, then the deputy CEO for a U.K. charity called Alcohol Concern, gave up drinking in January while training for a half marathon. Robinson was thrilled with the results: Not only did she lose weight, sleep better, and have more energy for the race, it seemed everyone wanted to talk to her about what it was like to stop drinking for a month. She decided to take her experiment to her job, where she could help more people experience the same benefits of a monthlong alcohol fast.Alcohol Concern merged with Alcohol Research U.K. in 2012 to form Alcohol Change, a nonprofit focused on improving public health in the U.K. by reducing alcohol-related harm. Inspired by Robinson, Alcohol Change launched the first official Dry January initiative in 2013. Around 4,000 people took part that year according to a survey by market research firm YouGov. The Dry January movement has grown steadily since: Between 2017 and 2019, YouGov surveys show more than four million people in the U.K. have participated each year.“Dry January is a time when each of us can take a look at our drinking habits and decide whether we’re happy with them, setting us up for the year ahead,” says Julie Symes, a senior communication manager at Alcohol Change. “Drinking alcohol can be fun, but it also has drawbacks and risks, so it’s vital that we all talk and think about our drinking, so we can make decisions rather than falling into habits that might not be healthy.”​There’s evidence to suggest that a month of abstinence from booze can do the body some good, especially if you’re someone who consumes alcohol regularly. Research published in the U.K. in 2018 found that quitting drinking for 30 days had a notable effect on health.The study followed 141 moderate-to-heavy drinkers who consumed an average of 30 drinks a week (more than double the U.K.-recommended limit of 14 drinks a week for both men and women). Of these people, 94 gave up drinking completely for a month while the remainder continued drinking as normal. Blood samples drawn at the end of the month showed no significant changes among the people who drank while the nondrinkers saw benefits in the reduction of blood cancer proteins along with other health benefits, like lower blood pressure, lower cholesterol, and a reduced risk of diabetes.The Dry January alcohol fast can also have a longer-term effect on drinking habits for some people. A different 2018 U.K. study of more than 800 Dry January devotees found that 70% of people who abstained were still drinking less seven months later. Among the people in the study, the average number of drinking days per week dropped from 4.3 to 3.3 from January to August, and the average number of times a month people reported being drunk dropped from 3.4 times to 2.1.Whether people choose to abstain from alcohol because of health concerns or guilt about gluttony, Dry January makes for an appealing challenge for anyone who wants to ensure that their drinking habits are “normal” or at least within their control. This motivation can feel especially strong in American culture, where hitting the brakes on a bad habit is just as prevalent as bad habits themselves.In the United States last year, 1 in 5 people (of 1,496 participants) surveyed by YouGov said they were doing Dry January. There’s no official, government-sanctioned effort for Dry January in the States, but it’s not hard to find grassroots support for alcohol abstinence. There are Dry January programs sponsored by local health care systems, Dry January Facebook groups, and brands like Heineken peddling their own Dry January products.Longer-term abstinence, sometimes referred to as elective sobriety, has also become an American trend. As writer Virginia Sole-Smith wrote in Elemental in April, it’s not surprising that people in the U.S. are questioning their relationship with alcohol given how great an influence drinking has on American socializing. “I thought often of all the times I’ve ordered a drink I didn’t particularly want to avoid the social awkwardness of not holding one; of how many friends’ pregnancies I’ve sussed out because it’s so noteworthy when they suddenly switch to seltzer,” Sole-Smith writes. “We’ve made alcohol a de facto part of ending the workday, eating brunch, celebrating birthdays, and so many other mundane moments of daily life; it is embedded in what it means to be a sophisticated adult, eating amazing food, wearing great clothes, and generally living the good life.”When people swing between excess and deprivation, it’s usually due to what he calls an “evolutionary mismatch” between the brain and its surroundings.As much as it’s a chance for better health and personal growth, Dry January is also reflective of the excess and deprivation cycle that’s become rampant in American culture. Giving up alcohol might seem like a natural, necessary consequence after a period of heavier drinking or even a method for setting better future habits in motion. But experts say a monthlong fast isn’t the best way to promote healthy, long-term habits even if there are short-term health benefits.“I do think that there is a mentality in the U.S. especially that people will drink to excess in parties and other social situations, and the counterweight to that is ‘let me just do something like Dry January and cut it off.’ It’s a boom or bust kind of cycle,” says Art Markman, a psychologist at the University of Texas, Austin, who studies consumer behavior and decision-making. “But the strategy of a one-month trial period doesn’t create a process for living your life with moderation.”Moderation isn’t exactly a hallmark of American consumption, partly because people are hardwired to want more when more is available. Glenn Geher, an evolutionary psychology professor at SUNY New Paltz, says when people swing between excess and deprivation, it’s usually due to what he calls an “evolutionary mismatch” between the brain and its surroundings. Basically, the brain hasn’t evolved to deal with having an abundance of resources available. Geher says evolutionary mismatches can occur in virtually any context, from technology and pornography to substances like alcohol and tobacco.Thousands of years ago, because food was scarce (and needed to be hunted and gathered), human ancestors wouldn’t have taken a “break” from food or other substances. Today humanity has an abundance of resources, including easy access to a cheap bottle of chardonnay, but people are still wired with the same scarcity mindset — which can lead to an unhealthy excess.“We, like any organism, evolved to hoard resources because once, resources were scarce,” Geher says. “We now live in a world where you can get as much high-calorie cheap food and alcohol as you want, and that’s why we go on diets and need to moderate. We have environmental conditions we didn’t evolve to anticipate.”Unhealthy consumption patterns are also associated with how accessible everything is for most Americans, Geher says. “Most middle-class people can afford to drink every night if they want. We live in an existence where the resources we evolved to crave because they were rare are now plentiful,” he says. That means it’s easier to overdo it, and not just with food.Geher recognizes how hard it is to maintain a healthy balance when surrounded by things the brain is wired to desire. But he doesn’t see total deprivation as the solution. “Cultivating moderation, especially with alcohol, is famously difficult,” he says. “All of these unnatural things co-opt our brains and give us more than we ever would have had under ancestral conditions, but I think the all-or-nothing, on-the-wagon, off-the-wagon thing can be dangerous.”“You truly have a lot more agency when everything is on the table and nothing is ‘good’ or ‘bad.’”Christy Harrison, a dietitian and author of Anti-Diet, believes a more moderate approach to cutting back could yield more health benefits than cycles of abundance and periods of deprivation because most black-and-white approaches are inherently self-perpetuating. “When people are pulled over to the side of restriction, there’s this inevitable pendulum swing into feeling out of control. That’s a natural response to restriction,” she says.It’s also due to an American tendency to label things — especially food and even alcohol — as “good” and “bad.”“If you feel out of control in an area of your life, the solution isn’t to exert even more control and forbid something but to try to make peace with that thing, to find a middle ground,” she says. “You can choose what feels good, satisfying, and pleasurable. You truly have a lot more agency when everything is on the table and nothing is ‘good’ or ‘bad.’”If people drink because they’re wired for excess and then deprive themselves to make up for it and neither is an effective long-term strategy, how can they achieve moderation? Markman says as much as deprivation fuels excessive behavior, adopting moderation can breed motivation. It’s often easier to stick to goals when you allow yourself a bit of a gray area. That’s thanks to a real psychological phenomenon called the ‘‘what the hell effect.” Essentially, when you draw a bright line between right and wrong, on the day you happen to step over the line, you’re much more likely to say “screw it.”“You think, ‘As long as I’m already across the line, I may as well do whatever. If I’m doing Dry January and have a drink, I may as well have six drinks,’” Markman says. On the other hand, if you adopt a more realistic, moderate goal to have four drinks a week and you accidentally have five, you’ll be more likely to stay the course for the long haul. “Five is still close to four, so you’ll have more motivation to stick with what you’re doing,” Markman says.In addition to promoting deprivation and binge cycles, there’s another reason Dry January — and really any fast — may not work long-term: It doesn’t give you any opportunity to rehearse moderation. “You’re not practicing going out in a social situation and having two drinks. It is that practice that turns out to be important because you have to confront a temptation to have more and develop strategies to avoid that,” Markman says. “If you don’t figure that out in advance, you’re putting yourself in the face of temptation, and the most natural thing to do is to give in to it.”For a better shot at long-term sustainability, Markman says it’s probably best not to treat it as a crash diet. “Even if you nail Dry January, you haven’t learned anything that would lead you to be able to change your life,” he says. If you do opt to participate in Dry January, the key to a better long-term relationship with alcohol is thinking through how you plan to handle drinking when February 1 rolls around. Because in the absence of any additional planning, February 1 is really no different than December 31.Written by"
51,Your Only New Year’s Resolution Should Be to Hibernate,"It’s nearly January 1. Instead of popping a painkiller and heading full throttle into 360-degree total life reform, here’s a novel thought: What if you chose to stay cozy under the blanket just a little longer, using that time for extra sleep, meditation, or quiet reflection? And what if taking it easy was actually the healthier choice — truly the best way to start the upcoming year off right?Despite the New Year’s Day trope of repenting, reinventing, and heading to the gym immediately, many of the world’s most ancient and trusted healing philosophies advocate an opposite approach to this midwinter period. Hibernate, they say.Practices from Ayurveda to traditional Chinese medicine (or TCM) espouse common principles like “grounding,” which refers to the concept of finding balance and connection in one’s life by acting in accordance with our natural internal instincts and the Earth’s seasonal cycles. “Winter offers us an opportunity to connect deeply with ourselves — physically and mentally preparing for new growth ahead,” explains Dr. Pratima Raichur, a chemist, botanist, Ayurvedic physician, and author. “In Ayurveda, we use nature as our teacher. The shorter, dark days — full of water, ice, and snow — are a time of cleansing, gestating, and preparing for the new beginnings of spring.”Ayurveda is a more than 3,000-year-old system of medicine that aims to treat individuals by creating balance in the body based on three elemental categories called “doshas,” representing elements like earth, fire, water, air, and ether. According to that philosophy, and many other healing traditions, when it’s cold outside and the days are shorter, the best way to care for our minds and bodies is to slow down, store up energy, nourish ourselves, and make preparations for the coming year.Perhaps the most important — and logical — way to store energy for warmer days is to get ample sleep. According to Rachel Abrams, MD, integrative and family medicine doctor and author of Body Wise: Discovering Your Body’s Intelligence for Lifelong Health and Healing, Americans currently get an average of six-and-a-half hours of sleep per night. At the turn of the 20th century, the average was nine to 10 hours. That reduction is, in part, due to the proliferation of electricity. Back in the day, when it got dark, people sat by fire or candlelight or went to bed. “Winter is the natural time to sleep more, and Mother Nature is helping us out by creating more darkness,” says Dr. Abrams (known as “Doctor Rachel” by her patients), whose approach involves looking at root causes of disease and at the entire life of each patient. “We’re such a sleep-deprived culture, which negatively impacts mood, creativity, concentration, and patience with children and colleagues. So, we should really be stopping work and going to bed earlier.”The biggest modern-day deterrent to getting more sleep is screen time. According to Dr. Abrams, not only do our devices distract us, they also send the wrong physiological signals to our bodies. Full-spectrum blue light wakes us up and suppresses the body’s melatonin production. (According to a study in Sleep Medicine, teenagers who use devices for even an hour a day get appreciably less sleep than they did just six years ago.)Full-spectrum lights aren’t all bad, though. Dr. Abrams recommends surrounding yourself with them during daytime hours — either by getting outside, buying full-spectrum bulbs or even buying a light box (which has the added bonus of helping with seasonal affective disorder in both serious cases and for people who just feel a bit down and crave tons of carbs). “When the light hits the back of your retina, it helps ward off depression in winter months,” she explains. Using those lights exclusively in daytime can help your body regulate melatonin levels for bedtime. Then, at night, Abrams advises a switch to dim yellow incandescent lights, which help your body prepare for sleep.In terms of setting new goals or habits, Dr. Abrams suggests integrating more restful, quiet practices in winter. “If you want to change your life, then you have to change your mind and attitude and there’s no better way to do that than with meditation,” she says. “It’s the perfect kind of resolution because, if you get your mind in the right place, everything else follows.”“Just as trees lose their leaves and animals hibernate (as we are animals too), we’re meant to stay in and do more restorative activities… Then, springtime is when you want to burst forth with the energy that’s been stored.”In traditional Chinese medicine (or TCM), winter is also seen as a time of restful contemplation. “We look to nature for cues,” says Holly Crafts Colasanti, a licensed acupuncturist and board-certified Chinese herbalist. “Just as trees lose their leaves and animals hibernate (as we are animals too), we’re meant to stay in and do more restorative activities. We’re going for a more yin space that’s about quietude and turning inward. Then, springtime is when you want to burst forth — like the blooming of the leaves and flowers — with the energy that’s been stored.”Starting the new year off with a commitment to a healthier diet is a positive impulse, but adopting an all salad or raw food diet may not actually be beneficial. In fact, it may put unnecessary strain on the body. “Chinese medicine discourages eating cold and raw foods in winter because they slow you down,” she explains. “Your body is already being asked to warm itself metabolically because of the cold temperatures; eating cooling summer foods — cucumbers or watermelon, for example — is asking your body to do extra work. That uses up a lot of energy that you’re supposed to be storing.”One clear marker of winter stress can be dehydrated or cracked skin, so that’s something to watch. Crafts Colasanti, who was inspired to pursue TCM because of her own struggles with psoriasis, often approaches this challenge by using food as medicine. To keep the body working optimally, she suggests nourishing and warming cooked dishes like baked pears, sweet potatoes, and stew. Fermented foods — from kefir to sauerkraut — are also helpful, she says, as they fan our inherent metabolic fire by supporting the diversity and healthy populations of intestinal flora and gut microbiota.Above all else, Crafts Colasanti suggests bone broth and, for vegetarians and vegans, mushroom broth (with dried and fresh mushrooms), both rich in collagen and minerals. “Bone broth is great for retaining flexibility in your skin and bones,” she explains. “And you want that secure barrier in order to withstand environmental stressors like wind and cold.”What does “grounding” look like, in practice? “The beginning of winter is dry and crisp, which is high on air energy, while the snowy, damp time of the season is a manifestation of earth and water energies. This means we should practice and enjoy activities that are warm, dry, and light,” explains Raichur.That doesn’t mean lying around and doing nothing, necessarily. It just suggests focusing more on preparation, connection, and cleansing than on intense forward motion. “There is deep work that needs to be done in winter,” Raichur asserts. “It is a ripe time to plant seeds of intention.” She suggests donating old or unused belongings, instituting self-care regimens like warm baths with uplifting aromatherapy oils, eating and drinking warm foods and teas, and spending time with friends and family. “Love each other, feed each other, be close and feel your sense of connection and vitality soar!”There’s a time and place for pushing forward, full-force, and midwinter isn’t necessarily it. But the colder season offers other compensations, including an opportunity to rest, look inward, and mindfully prepare for the coming spring.Written by"
52,Your Life Is Not a Story,"Recently I visited some old friends who moved, a few years ago, from New York City to Portland, Oregon. In New York, Brian and Lara had been the staying-at-homest people I knew, which made sense since they also had the nicest home of anyone I knew — a large apartment on the 45th floor in midtown, with a view of the Chrysler and Empire State Buildings. Our usual routine was: I’d go over to their place, we’d order takeout, have some wine, and watch something like Battlestar Galactica. But since moving to Portland, they have unexpectedly, at age 50, become rave kids. To hear them explain it, it was a natural progression: They realized they really enjoyed dancing at weddings, and it occurred to them that they didn’t need to wait for a wedding to dance, so they started checking out some local clubs, and now they go almost every weekend. But when you only see a snapshot of your friends once every few years, gradual changes look like abrupt, bizarre metamorphoses: when they first sent me photos of themselves in luminescent costumes with goggles, antennae, and diaphanous capes, I felt like a Philip K. Dick character getting a glimpse into an alternate timeline.“I have often noticed,” writes Humbert Humbert in Nabokov’s Lolita, “that we are inclined to endow our friends with the stability of type that literary characters acquire in the reader’s mind.” One of the things I liked about my old friend Skelly was that whenever I saw him he was always so exactly himself, in fact even more himself than I’d remembered; he always borrowed 20 dollars, was always the first to spill a drink, always put on Led Zeppelin before passing out. He was as consistent as a cartoon character, like Wimpy with his hamburgers-on-credit habit. He stayed the same old Skelly right up until he broke character by unexpectedly dropping dead and revealing himself to have been secretly insane, with a house full of nightmarish detritus. It’s easy to forget that we only ever see facets of other people, never the whole (not even in marriage) — and in those facets what we’re mostly seeing is some aspect of ourselves.More and more I’m simply interested in seeing how everyone else’s choices turned out, what became of us all.Years ago I wrote an essay called “The Referendum,” about how people eye each other’s differing life choices — about careers, marriage, kids, homes — with envy or disapproval, out of an underlying anxiety about having chosen the wrong life themselves. But by the time you’re past life’s midpoint, and your own life starts to look more like a fait accompli than a work-in-progress, your investment in defending or second-guessing your own decisions ebbs; more and more I’m simply interested in seeing how everyone else’s choices turned out, what became of us all — my own small sample of results in the uncontrolled experiment that is life. I like it, for purely selfish, spectatorial reasons, whenever people do the less conventional, less expected thing in life, the same way I enjoy certain friends who aren’t necessarily “nice” people, because they’re like characters in a book who reliably make any scene they’re in more interesting. My friend Kevin, surely in the running for my most irresponsible friend, a crowded and competitive field — this is a man who gave himself gout with his excess — has fathered a child, and is now, to all appearances, a happy small-town dad. Another friend, Harold, has meanwhile announced his retirement “from public life,” and now dedicates himself to “The Great Work”: reading rare and obscure works of supernatural literature. My friend Diana realized, a few years ago, that she identified as queer: The catalyst for this epiphany was falling in love with a trans partner, which allowed her to embrace aspects of herself she’d always resisted and flout conventions she’d too long felt bound by. When I first met her, she dressed like Nancy Drew — not unfeminine, but more girl-detective than girly-girl. She’s since declared she’s never wearing a goddamn dress again; she wore a dapper pinstriped vest and pants at her wedding. (It’s one of the sillier items in the PRO column in my deciding whether to have children at 50: No one will have seen that coming.) It’s exhilarating to thwart the predictable script, break free of determinism now and then and flex what little free will we have. These twists and reversals remind me that I don’t know people as well as I think I do, and reassure me that we’re all still capable, even in midlife, of surprise.Surveying this local panorama of human destinies, it’s hard to know what general conclusion they might entail other than: Life is certainly funny.Not that we’re obliged to make our lives interesting for the amusement of some imaginary reader-God. There’s a difference between what we want to want, or think we ought to want, and what we actually want, and the sooner we recognize which is which, the happier we’ll be. A former student of mine confessed that she felt as though she’d given up, been defeated, when she left New York (a city that makes you look cool but feel miserable), but once she accepted her exile in the Bay Area, she couldn’t believe she was allowed to live a life she enjoyed so much. Brian and Lara’s life in Portland isn’t one I would’ve chosen for myself, but they seem far happier than they were in Manhattan, vegging out on the couch. Harold has renounced the company of womankind, and is drifting contentedly out of touch with humanity in his recliner, reading titles like The Flying Beast, but he is inarguably a happier man than I am; he knows exactly what he wants to do with his remaining time on Earth, and he’s doing it. Surveying this local panorama of human destinies, it’s hard to know what general conclusion they might entail other than: Life is certainly funny.I write nonfiction because I don’t understand life well enough to make things up. Back when I studied writing in college, even today’s tiny, fragile publishing niche for essay and memoir didn’t exist, so we were taught to write short stories. I had no aptitude for fiction: I could never figure out how to reconcile the demands of Aristotelian dramaturgy with verisimilitude, to construct a satisfying story that resembled anything like real life. The narrative form real life most closely resembles is the soap opera — a long, meandering, pointless story without resolution, in which nothing much happens for long stretches, punctuated by the occasional incredible coincidence or improbable tragedy. It’s what Homer Simpson called “just a bunch of stuff that happened.” Inventing things that might plausibly happen would require a better grasp of life’s basic operating principles than I can pretend to; all I can do is write down what actually happened, and maybe venture some guesses as to why. The best fiction acknowledges that character is too complex to define, destiny unguessable: only bad stock characters are consistent and predictable; great literary characters, like people in real life, remain a little elusive, their motives opaque even to themselves. The novels I reread most often are ones whose characters are credible, familiar, but hover just the other side of comprehensibility; every time I open the book I hope that if only they’d make different decisions at crucial moments, it might all turn out differently.It’s a mistake to try to force your life to conform to a script. I still have the timeline of my future life that I wrote up in pencil on a piece of college-ruled notebook paper when I was 12. Let’s see: By my present age I was supposed to have already published several science fiction novels and run for President. (You know how it goes; it’s hard to get around to everything. I did write some books, at least.) This is why I have so little helpful advice to give younger colleagues: Unless your life has gone boringly according to plan, it probably isn’t a replicable sequence of intentional steps. It’s less like a pathway — deliberately cut, following the most efficient route — than stepping-stones: a random scattering of happenstance that led you where you are now. It’s also a fallacy, if an irresistible one, to try to interpret life like a text (this is at least one purpose of therapy: to render your life as an intelligible narrative). Beyond a few broad Aesop’s morals — e.g., drugs appear to be bad for you, children seem to make people feel fulfilled, once you have enough money to live on, making more doesn’t make you any happier — we’re all just groping our way through the days, lucky if we get a moment to wonder what life is for. We barely have enough time to collect enough data to draw any conclusions before it’s all over. A recurring religious metaphor is that if we could only step back far enough to view the mosaic whole, it would form a coherent picture — God’s master plan, the grand design — and at last we would understand. For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face.I recently saw 63 Up, the latest, and possibly last, installment in director Michael Apted’s Up series of documentaries, a longitudinal study chronicling the lives of a group of English men and women from the ages of seven through 63, checking in once every seven years. Apted began these films with an agenda about the determinism of class, which the films don’t invalidate, but also obviate as less relevant or interesting than the bigger mysteries of personality, life, and time. The Up series is one of the great projects in the history of cinema, an attempt to apprehend a glimpse of life whole. Its cumulative effect is a feeling beyond any emotion we have a word for, a resolution beyond sad or happy endings: It’s a fleeting God’s-eye view of life’s length and brevity, the eerie poignancy of time’s passage. It’s a perspective afforded by very few other works of art I can think of: Eliot’s Middlemarch, John Williams’s Stoner, Ozu’s Tokyo Story, Kubrick’s Barry Lyndon. For an instant we can almost make out the pattern, and in it is not meaning but beauty.I made the mistake of extrapolating in a straight-line trajectory from the present, failing to account for fortune’s corkscrew tangents.Once in a while, at weddings, reunions, or funerals, sometimes just at ordinary moments, looking around at the strange and varied fates that have been waiting for us all this time, I get a twinge of this same sensation. I feel as if I’ve traveled into the future. When I was in high school, I once made a minor time-wasting project of drawing a scrapbook from the future, illustrating all my friends’ adult lives. I wasn’t far off in some cases — although, like most people, I made the mistake of extrapolating in a straight-line trajectory from the present, failing to account for fortune’s corkscrew tangents. I imagine traveling back in time now, a visitant from the distant Blade Runner year of 2019, to the eve of high school graduation 1985, to tell my old gang their fortunes: You become an MD/PhD at the National Institute of Health (no surprise there; that’s one life that went according to plan). You’re an architect and a scout leader, with two sons. You’re disabled by depression, but have a loving and supportive wife and you’re a good husband and father. You drift from one job and state to another and die in your forties, an addict. You’ve become a broker and drive a Porsche; little trace remains of the mysterious hero once known as Beetleman. No come to think of it that’s a terrible idea. It’s probably a mercy that our future selves are quarantined off from us, that time’s firewall protects us from spoilers.One night during that trip to Portland, I got to experience a slice of Brian and Lara’s lives: All their assembled guests dressed up, took molly, and went to a rave. It happened to be Halloween weekend, and Portland enjoys a reputation, among itself, as “weird” — though it’s weird in a very white, distinctively dweeby way — which meant that there were a lot of creative, well-executed costumes on display. I saw a Spandexed fairy and a sexy Loki, a fishbowl-helmeted astronaut and Spider-Man unmasked, a tall, slender girl in a giraffe-patterned onesie and a man who’d encased his whole head in the solemn black rectangle and electronic eye of H.A.L. 9000. I saw couples entwined and undulate on the dance floor, heaps of depleted revelers flopped atop one another on cushioned daises like litters of kittens. One side effect of molly is to make people helplessly grind their teeth, which lent everyone an unfestively grotesque, feral aspect. The drug seemed to have a paradoxical effect on me, whereby rather than making me promiscuously tactile or emotionally incontinent, I became withdrawn and interior: Instead of dancing or drinking or flirting with any of the hundreds of friendly disinhibited enticingly costumed girls there, I wanted only to stand unobtrusively against a wall, observing from behind my kabuki demon mask and letting my thoughts drift around inside my head like a screensaver. I saw a woman whose face was encrusted in a mosaic of tiny mirrored tiles that shifted and flexed with her expressions (I learned it had taken her three hours to apply), each facet reflecting a fragment of the viewer. I watched several people mistake a mirror for a doorway and bonk ignominiously into their own reflections, not realizing the approaching stranger was themselves. For now we bonk into a glass, darkly. I stood there for hours, watching that chimerical crowd endlessly circulating, making grand entries and furtive exits, getting separated and regrouping, pairing up and parting again, the whole motley carnival, all those lovingly cultivated disguises, their true faces hidden, identities unknown.Written by"
53,Your Inability to Do Pullups Is All in Your Head,"Test Gym is a new Elemental column about the science of exercise.I’ve always loved pullups. They require nothing more than an overhead bar and some dig-deep grit. They’re a primal yet elegant way to test your might and strength-to-weight ratio while building core and upper-body strength.Pullups are also a show of power. Mark Wahlberg did 22 pullups in 30 seconds as a charity fundraiser on the Ellen DeGeneres Show. Former FBI boss James Comey told the New York Times he was spending the “unemployed celebrity” chapter of his life working toward a goal of doing 10 consecutive pullups.There’s a popular notion that certain bodies just aren’t capable of executing a proper pullup —the New York Times once tried to explain why women can’t do them — but there’s ample evidence to the contrary. Megan Rapinoe does pullups, because of course she does. And Eva Clarke, an Australian mother of three, set a world record in 2016 by pumping out 725 in one hour.Still, it’s true that pullups are naturally easier for some people than others. Pullups use your core, forearms, biceps, upper back, deltoids, and lats, so strength in those muscles is important, according to Stew Smith, a certified strength coach and former Navy SEAL. And it helps to be light — every extra pound is just extra weight you have to lift.The pullup is an attainable feat even if you aren’t one of those muscle heads shaped like a slice of pizza.Athletes who have strong upper bodies but are generally lean (think Nordic skiers and gymnasts) will usually have an easier time with pullups than cyclists or speedskaters, who carry their weight in their legs. Ideally, you want your weight concentrated in the body parts that are contributing to the work of a pullup, not the ones that are dead weight while you’re hoisting yourself up to the bar.But the pullup is an attainable feat even if you aren’t one of those muscle heads shaped like a slice of pizza. Marine Lt. Col. Misty Posey is living proof. Posey, who had never done sports, learned to do her first pullup out of necessity. The U.S. Marine Corps did not include pullups in the physical fitness test for women until 2017, but the officer boot camp Posey had to pass when she was becoming a Marine in the 1990s required her to get over obstacles that, at just 4 feet 10 inches tall, she was too short to jump over. Her only option was to pull herself up and over them.Posey spent almost a year trying to go from zero to one pullup using a pullup-assist machine at the base’s gym. Despite working her way up to doing 90% of her body weight for 10 pullups with the machine, she still couldn’t do a single unaided pullup. A gunnery sergeant at the gym saw Posey’s futile efforts and told her to give up the machine — it was a crutch. “Get out of the gym, and go work on the pullup bar,” he told her, instructing Posey to do a series of pullup variations like jumping pullups and half pullups.The advice was so simple that she almost dismissed it, but it worked. Three days later, Posey did her first pullup. And then she kept going.On a bet from a fellow Marine—a man who seemed surprised she could do any pullups at all—Posey worked her way up to 23 consecutive pullups in less than eight weeks to win the bet and kick her doubter’s ass. Accomplishing a pullup can be a symbol of female empowerment. When you do a pullup, Posey says, “You become the master of your own body. It’s a way to get respect.”Simply believing that you can do a pullup isn’t enough to get you there. But the notion that you can’t may be part of what’s stopping you.In the years since her first pullup, Posey has become a pullup evangelist. She has helped countless women and men of every body type learn to do the iconic exercise. “I’ve had mothers and grandmothers, and I’ve had women with up to 29% body fat get their first pullup,” she says.In hindsight, Posey says that the biggest thing stopping her from that first pullup was her own erroneous belief that she couldn’t.Of course, simply believing that you can do a pullup isn’t enough to get you there. But the notion that you can’t may be part of what’s stopping you. There’s a psychology at play in situations like these, says Sandra Hunter, an exercise scientist at Marquette University. She recalls a male colleague who decided that for his 50th birthday, he was going to do 50 pushups. Hunter told him that if he can do 50, he could probably do 100. “He told me I’d blown his mind. He was a sports psychologist, and he never had the gall to consider that he might do that.” He ended up doing 200 pushups, and half of the effort was just deciding that he could, she says.“The reason why most people cannot do pullups is that they do not practice pullups,” says Smith, the former Navy SEAL. Posey adds that the problem with pullup-assist machines and other exercises is that they don’t fully replicate the motor pattern of an actual pullup.Posey’s pullup training guide outlines about a dozen pullup-based exercises, but she has helped hundreds of people achieve pullups with a training plan that consists of just a few simple exercises — essentially just different ways of practicing pullups. (Posey is expecting her first child in a few months and soon will be updating her pullup manifesto to include advice for doing pullups during pregnancy.)Posey’s plan centers around three essential exercises: partner-assisted pullups, “negatives,” and jumping pullups.In the partner-assisted drills, you hang on the bar and initiate a pullup. When you start to falter, your partner helps by spotting you on the middle and upper back (not your feet).In the negative pullup, you stand on a chair or stool to get yourself to the top of the pullup bar and then slowly lower yourself down. This might seem easier than lifting yourself up, Posey says, but it’s a very effective way of getting better at pullups because it’s an eccentric move, which means that your muscle is lengthening. Eccentric exercises stimulate the muscle fibers and nerves and help build strength.In the jumping pullup, you jump up to give yourself a boost at the start and avoid beginning from a dead hang.You can put it all together by doing pullup progressions — sets of pullup exercises that you increase in number over time. The Posey plan involves doing sets of these exercises three to five times per day, three to five times per week. “The goal is to do as many as you can in a particular day without wearing yourself out,” she says.Technique is important, Posey says. Grip the bar tightly with your pinkie knuckle over the top of the bar. Tuck in your pelvis, and keep your abs tight. Pull your arms down into your shoulder sockets, and keep your shoulders down (the opposite of shrugging). Hang your legs straight, and keep your head neutral. As you begin the exercise, keep your abs and glutes tight, and concentrate on pulling your elbows to your ribs and your chin over the bar (don’t lift your chin up).Some of your initial strength gains at the beginning of a training program will actually come from neural changes, says Hunter, the Marquette University exercise scientist. A pullup is a dynamic movement that requires stabilizing the shoulder and recruiting multiple muscles; by practicing the pullup exercise itself, you’re teaching your nervous system how to do the move. “You need a certain amount of coordination and motor control,” Hunter says.Pullup progressions can help people go from zero to one pullup, but they’re also how pullup world record holder John Orth trained for his feat. Orth, a violin builder from Golden, Colorado, holds the record for the most pullups completed in 24 hours: 7,600.Orth set an interval timer to go off every 30 or 40 seconds. Every time it buzzed, he would do a set of six or seven pullups; he continued this for two or three hours per day. On his most serious training days, he’d set the timer for 15 or 20 seconds and do sets at that interval for as long as he was able. Orth supplemented this training with a pullup-assist machine that he would use like a rowing machine, doing pullups at half his body weight for up to an hour straight. He also did pullups with a weight belt. “It made it so that when I wasn’t wearing the weight belt, it made me feel extra light,” he says.This feeling that Orth could rip them out is key, because, as Posey discovered on that fateful day when she achieved her first one, how many pullups you can do—or whether you can do one at all—may be all in your head.Written by"
54,TikTok Is the New Home for Thinspo,"Towards the end of December, TikTok’s content soundtracked by “All I Want For Christmas” was beginning to wane, and videos focused on weight loss goals for the New Year started to appear.One of the most ubiquitous trends features users creating a “weight loss shake” comprised of cucumber, pineapple, and water. While that might seem like a dangerous concoction even to someone without a background in nutrition, certified nutritionists on TikTok were quick to make split-screen videos outlining just how misguided using the drink as a meal replacement can be.While there is an increasing number of health professionals using their own TikTok videos to spread information about healthy weight loss, users sharing dangerous tips, misguided encouragement, and a fair amount of body-shaming still appear on the platform, reminiscent of #thinspo communities on older social media platforms.#thinspo, online communities championing disordered eating, have been making headlines since the early 2010s, popping up on everything from Tumblr to Pinterest. TikTok content that could fall under this umbrella can sometimes be found under the tag #thinspiration, though other hashtags like #weightloss and #weightlosscheck also feature users outlining daily food habits with very, very low calorie counts. While these tags can also be a place for those who have lost weight in a healthy way to share and celebrate their progress, there are plenty of videos on the platform that champion losing weight fast, seemingly at any cost. And combined, videos posted using those three tags have a combined 2.1 billion views.According to TikTok’s recently-updated community guidelines, “Content that promotes eating habits that are likely to cause health issues is also not allowed on the platform.” Forbidden content includes“pro-ana or other dangerous behavior to lose weight.”The guidelines make the distinction that content around eating disorder recovery and other forms of support for those in recovery is allowed, and the platform has been a place for eating disorder (ED) survivors to post triumphs and words of support for others. But “thinspiration” content still gets through. TikTok did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.Hannah Magee, a registered dietitian who has been creating TikTok content for about two months, described another troubling meme making the rounds. “I definitely have seen content that glamorizes or normalizes disordered eating among young women, which is really unfortunate.” Magee points to the use of Ke$ha’s ‘Your Love is My Drug’, with its line “Maybe I need some rehab”, as promoting unhealthy behavior. “There were many teens using this audio to share and joke about restricting food, binge-eating and over-exercising.”Magee has noticed more of this troublesome content on TikTok than other social platforms. “From what I’ve seen so far, I think that I’ve seen more disordered or unhealthy content on TikTok in such a short amount of time than other social media platforms that I use,” she said. “That could be due to the fact that I really filter out my Instagram and Twitter pages from any accounts that promote diet culture and disordered behaviors and I find it’s a little harder to that on the For You Page of TikTok.”“As TikTok gets more popular, we will see more and more misinformation being put out”According to Sarah Grace Meckelberg, a registered dietician with a masters in exercise physiology, the main examples of disordered eating content on the platform she’s encountered include videos that showcase severe cases of undereating as well as “weird detox drinks like one with lemon and cucumber.” Beyond critiquing dangerous trends like the cucumber shake in split-screen videos, Mackelberg has also attempted to combat what she describes as “nutrition fake news.”For Brittany Mock, a TikTok user who has a BS and an MS in nutrition and dietetics, user’s comments on certain videos showcase the body-shaming happening on the platform. “I have also noticed several accounts calling out ‘fat people’ stating why they are fat, as if they know the reason without even knowing the person. That is the kind of content we shouldn’t be seeing on social media because we know from research that weight gain and obesity can be due to a variety of reasons. Diet culture is so embedded in our lives, most don’t realize how even subtle comments and actions can affect someone.”Though Mock said when it comes to her TikTok content she’s “absolutely trying to combat diet culture,” she isn’t seeing too much disordered eating content spreading on the platform — for now. “I will say Instagram and Facebook have a lot more unhealthy content on their platforms due to the popularity of them being higher,” Mock said. “I can predict as TikTok gets more popular, we will see more and more misinformation being put out.”Written by"

56,How to Make Your Dreams Come True,"My teacher wants to see me after class.I don’t know why. I have absolutely no idea. I’m 12 years old, and I’m not a troublemaker of any sort. I’m far too shy for that.She scratches her nose as if she’s uncomfortable. It’s hot in the classroom, and I’m uncomfortable too.“Your results came back from the English exam.”I remember that we took an exam a few days ago, an international one. It’s supposed to test our ability in English. All the students speak English — we attend an English-medium school in a former British colony, but we have wildly varying levels of proficiency.She says, as if it were a problem rather than an achievement, “You have a Distinction.”I look at the certificate she hands me. It says my name right there, on top of a scoring key. I see that Distinction is the highest score.“You’re the only student in the class that got Distinction. But don’t think this makes you special.”I am lost, but she continues: “I’ve seen your attitude in class — you’re very arrogant. As arrogant as the devil. I don’t want this to encourage you. You have to learn some humility. You’re not that good.”There’s a few more words, but I don’t hear them. Finally she dismisses me, and I can sense that she is relieved. I walk out of the room clutching my Distinction certificate in small hot hands. Now I know it doesn’t mean anything.Where to begin.We obsess over beginnings. People want a good origin story. They ask this question all the time: When did it begin? They ask this of gay people, of sick people, and of artists. When did you find out? When did it begin? And for me the answer is always “When did what begin? If you mean, when did I start writing, well, I started writing when I was seven years old.”It’s true. I knew I wanted to write from the time I could write. I stole my parents’ office notebooks and wrote poems in them. I still remember lines from one poem: “The lacy little wavelet/On the brown shore.” I remember being inordinately proud of that line.That’s when I started writing, but I never called myself a writer. I was just good at English, that’s all. Writing was something I did for myself. I did it all through high school, and then college, and then law school. I kept journals; I blogged; I tweeted; I wrote jokes on Facebook because I had to write. I dreamed of growing up to be a real writer. I was like Wendy in Peter Pan, not ready to face the heartbreak of being grown up.It’s an interesting question: this question of who gets to call themselves a “real writer.” Is it a good or bad thing? Why do twentysomething white girls on Thought Catalog declare with swagger, “I’m working on my first book about New York,” when Haruki Murakami says that being a writer is kind of embarrassing? What mysterious world divides those two?The problem with hard work is that it’s fundamentally boring to talk about.Some say you’re a real writer when you get paid for writing. Most people would agree that you can call yourself a writer when you’ve been published. I blew past both those milestones and still didn’t call myself a writer. Like Murakami, I disliked the very word. When people said of me, she writes, I said, “I’m a lawyer.” I didn’t want to seem foolish. Writers were people like John Steinbeck and Ernest Hemingway: meaty, big, important. Writers were not alright at writing. Writers were very, very, very good.For a while, I was obsessed with talent shows. There’s this talent show called The Voice. It’s a pretty cheesy show, to be honest. Hopeful people come from all over America, from New York and Massachusetts and small towns in the Midwest. People with real careers already, grown-ups. They walk onto a stage — the judges are sitting with their backs to the contestants, so they have no idea what they look like. Then the spotlight comes up, and they begin to sing.If a judge likes their voice, they hit a button that turns their chair around. That moment, when the chair turns around, is the main reason I watch the show. The expression on the face of the contestant — rich, complicated, joy struggling with disbelief — is one we are rarely allowed to witness.For contestants on The Voice, it’s a moment of vindication. Somebody, Somebody Who Mattered, has told them they are a real singer.Artists often talk about that moment. It’s a dream: to be “discovered” the same way a talent scout may see a sulky, skinny 14-year-old in the mall and realize she has the face of a supermodel. To be a young Roald Dahl sending a famous writer notes on his story only to hear “You’ve written my story already. Did you know you were a writer?”Of course, it rarely happens that way. It’s more likely to happen like it happened to J.K. Rowling, who struggled through rejections from so many publishers before one agreed to take on Harry Potter.Step Two: Being good with rejection.It’s deep winter in Massachusetts, and all around me the sky is gray. I’m sitting in my college advisor’s office, and he’s telling me that he’ll look at my work.“I’m going to tell you the truth,” he warns, twinkling at me from behind his desk. “Some people don’t want to hear the truth. But I’ll tell it to you. I can’t lie about your writing. I know when something’s not good.”I am amused. “Have you ever been wrong?”“Like, for instance, Sylvia Plath’s ‘Daddy’ is not a good poem.”“Really? Sylvia Plath’s ‘Daddy’? Really?”“Answer me this: what’s it about? What do all those extravagant words mean? That mess of stark images?”I thought quickly. “Well, it’s about her troubled relationship with her father, who she sees as a kind of Nazi figure in her life, right?”“Yeah, but what does it mean to say The black telephone’s off at the root? What, exactly, does that mean?”I’m confused. “I think it means that he can’t influence her anymore.”“You think, but you’re not sure. Which is why it’s not a great poem.”I don’t want to challenge him. I don’t yet have the entitlement to challenge people on their opinions. It will take me many more years, many long and painful years, to learn the first rudiments of it.“So? Will you show me your work?”With a smile, I decline. I hurry out of his office.If this man, this confident white man in his office knows that Sylvia Plath is not a great poet, what would he make of me? I cannot imagine.There’s a lot of talk about hard work, too.The problem with hard work is that it’s fundamentally boring to talk about. When Biggie raps “Birthdays was the worst days / Now we sip champagne when we’re thirsty,” we’re enraptured by his vision, by the romance of it, of going from nothing to something. It has to feel like a dream to us: It can’t feel like someone laying brick patiently over brick and announcing one day, Here is my house. Which is, sadly, how these things happen.It’s true that there is no substitute for talent. But talent without hard work is nothing, nothing at all. It flares briefly and explodes in the grey world, and afterward we are not sure if it was anything at all.I remember interviewing a woman who had worked with Michael Jackson, a musician, and I remember her telling me how hard he worked.“He’s the hardest working man I ever met in my life,” she said. “My whole life long. He was in the studio before other people and he was there long after other people left.”I wondered why he had to work that hard if he was Michael Jackson. It didn’t occur to me that he had to work that hard because he was Michael Jackson.Talent without hard work is nothing, nothing at all. It flares briefly and explodes in the grey world, and afterward we are not sure if it was anything at all.It is nearly summer.I am sitting in front of yet another teacher. This one is a guidance counselor at my boarding school.We are playing the old, old, game of “Guess What Will Happen to Everybody When They Grow Up.”Some kids get doctors, some get engineers, and some get lingerie designers. (My teacher likes to get creative.)It’s my turn. She looks at me speculatively and says “This one will be a housewife. She’ll have two kids by the time she’s 25.”I know she doesn’t mean it unkindly. In fact, she thinks it’s a compliment. I’m so shy, so painfully awkward in my adolescence, that she sees nothing special in me. She imagines my dreams to be narrow, circumscribed by my circumstances.Her words are burning in me, red and large like flowers. I will never forget them, I tell myself. I never do.There is a point to all these stories, I promise. I’m getting to it.If you have the genuine disease — if you are an honest-to-goodness dreamer — you have to understand a few things. The life is filled with people saying No to you. If you’re a woman, if you’re brown, many more people will say No to you. Many people will not believe that you’re special. They will tell you that you’re not special. Unless you have the kind of entitlement that comes with being rich, white, and having supportive parents, you will believe them. You will not have the audacity to move to New York at 20 to work on your first book. You would not dare.It will come slow to you, agonizingly slow. (There’s a phrase in India for people like this: strugglers. Strugglers are people who want to become famous actors. It’s the most appropriate word to describe their lives.)You will not quit your job right away. Maybe you will never be lucky enough to quit. Maybe you will have to work nights and weekends and lunch breaks, with no sexy Hollywood montage to speed things up.You have to own the shame and struggle of being an artist, and try not to listen when people laugh — because people will laugh.Hardest of all to hear, most painful, is this: Maybe the moment will never come. Strugglers are often doomed. Is that what you wanted to hear? It’s not, but what choice do you have?You have to wake up every day, every single day, and build your sandcastle with aching hands, with your aching raw hands. You have to own the shame and struggle of being an artist, and try not to listen when people laugh — because people will laugh. Worse: they will pity you, the way they pity people who link to their Soundcloud under Nicki Minaj videos.Nobody ever believes it until you get your book deal, your record deal, your movie deal. You will be the only one that believes it right until it happens. What choice do you have?In the end, I decided that you’re a writer when, in the words of Rainer Maria Rilke, you “would die if you were forbidden to write.” If you must write. That is the answer. Sweet, aching, satisfying and heartbreaking as it is to hear, that is the only answer.Written by"
57,Why Long Walks Will Change Your Life,"I am back home for Christmas, and yesterday, on Boxing Day, I walked in the rain from my village and down into the valley, then upwards and into the woodlands. This is my childhood village — a village called Shelley in the West Riding of Yorkshire. One woodland stands above and another at the bottom of the valley. On either side of the village, farmlands blanket endless rolling hills. A patchwork of green fields bordered by hedgerows and drystone walls cut across the landscape in every direction. Wildflowers and farm animals (mostly cows or sheep) abound, and the picture is dotted with the occasional ancient farmhouse or barn.The late sun spilled light through the trees and onto the footpath, and every so often a grey squirrel would scurry across my path and ascend the nearest tree until out of sight. Whenever you walk into the woods it feels as if you have entered a sanctuary — everything you think matters does not seem to matter all that much under the shelter of the trees. Trees are mysterious to me, like gods or mystics, infinitely wiser than humans, all-knowing, all-seeing, and we can only admire them from below.I could have walked anywhere: along the roads, over the green fields, across the towns and cities — but I always choose the woodlands. In the woods, I walk amongst my ancestors, and I am home. Even in childhood, the woods were where I felt closest to nature’s awe-inspiring workings.I most enjoy woodlands which are unkempt, with fallen trees and branches on the ground, brushes and brambles in sprawl, and no clear footpath. You have to find your own way through a deadly labyrinth of nettles, thorns, spines, and prickles. These wild woodlands are a fascinating reminder of what nature was like before humanity: a tangled, prickly, and venomous darkness, often hostile and sinister, but at the same time mysteriously beautiful. The wildest things are the most alive, and finding yourself amid the wilderness in an age when man has subdued every other part of life is refreshing.After some time walking along the narrow woodland path, I came across a lonely stream, which flowed through the heart of the woodlands and down the valley. A father watched over his young daughter, a happy, blonde girl, as she played with twigs and sticks and hopped across the stones that sat on the water. I smiled at the father, lunged over the water, and went onward through the trees. Some distance later, the trees stopped before a train track, which stretched across into the distance in a perfect straight line, headed in both directions for the industrial cities of Yorkshire. When I re-entered the woodlands, I was absorbed once again by the trees, the leaves, the sprays of sunlight, the crawling insects, the wet mud — the simple and forgotten things — and carried on toward the village.During my walks, I am in a constant, slow-burning rapture.Eventually, after about an hour and a half of walking, I reached the end of the footpath: a cricket pitch at the top of a hill in a village called Shepley — the name deriving from the Old English sceap (sheep) and leah (clearing), thus meaning “a clearing or meadow where sheep are kept.” At this point, I had a view of the entire landscape, including a full scope of my village on the hillside opposite. Beyond the village, I could see yet more farmlands and woodlands, a Victorian village church, Emmanuel Church, and in the far distance, Emley Moor, a broadcasting tower that pierces through the sky and watches over every village southeast of Huddersfield.Over the years, I must have walked this same route a thousand times, yet I’ve never tired of its charms. If one is attentive enough, every walk is an opportunity to see new sights and hear new sounds. On many occasions, I walked off the track and ended up in some unfamiliar landscape I never could have imagined. For the most part, the landscape of West Yorkshire is not very diverse; it’s mostly green fields and green hills that seem to stretch on forever. But on my local walks, I am an explorer, a pioneer, I am involved in the landscapes, and I notice the wonderful capabilities of the landscape to bend and fold over short distances. I learn the shapes and curves of different trees and plants, and I notice how they change throughout each season. On my walks I am in a constant, slow-burning rapture.Usually, I walk without a plan. I have nothing to achieve; the beauty is in the walking, in the journey itself. I depend on instinct and walk interminably, one foot in front of the other, breathing in the cold air, marveling at the stature of the oak trees, nodding and greeting the dog walkers who pass me by. And then, quite suddenly, ideas arrive. Stories unfold. Meaning and purpose are restored. Beautiful words, long sentences, poetry and rhyme, answers to dreaded questions — these all come in flashing moments when I am absorbed in the landscape, in the eternity of the natural world. It always takes me by surprise, and I often regret not carrying a notepad to write my thoughts down; I just have to hope I will remember everything when I get back home.In nature, you leave yourself behind. You are nobody in the woods. When faced with a particularly difficult problem, I find it’s always healthier to just get out of the house and go for a walk rather than trying to force the answer. For in the repetition of walking you empty yourself out, free yourself of opinion and expectation, and embody once again humanity’s innate character. In this state of emptiness, your mind begins to clear — and then the gods descend to fill the void. Freedom of movement stimulates the mind, bringing forth divine wisdom. A free body is a free mind; which is why, I suppose, the powers that be prefer we sit in offices and cubicles day and night, so that we are made forever stupid and loyal customers.In nature, you leave yourself behind.Indeed, like everyone else, I have days that require I sit inside the office or the library all day and work until the end. And on these days I always feel as if there is a small stove slowly burning in my stomach, a hollow pain, which grows fierier the longer I stifle my vitality. If evening comes and I have not walked far at all, then this fire cannot be contained and it becomes impossible to remain sitting still. I get so anxious that I cannot concentrate on even the simplest of tasks. My mind is exhausted but my body’s energy is idle and unsatisfied. If this energy does not find release through physical exertion, it seeps into the mind and transforms into worries, doubts, fears — what’s more, I can’t sleep, because the untapped life force whirls and spins around my mind, desperately trying to exert itself, keeping me awake. The life force I should be expressing through physical exertion turns back on my body and slowly destroys me.I take long walks because I have a body, and if I do not use my body then I become bad-tempered and apathetic. Those who concentrate solely on their intellect and leave the body behind tend to be rigid, stern characters, and unhealthy. As far as I can tell, each of us seems to have a primal drive toward life, which finds its easiest expression in the act of walking, in the act of moving forward through the natural world and marveling at its beauty. In my experience, all anxious and depressive feelings seem to dissipate when walking along a woodland path. And if you walk far enough you eventually achieve a state of joy — a quiet, inner happiness — and you are relieved, as you have escaped the walls, the squares, the eternity of sitting, of stagnation; now you are moving over the landscape, over the hills and far away, fighting against gravity, breathing fresh air, with a pulsing heart and an appetite for flowers and sunlight. You are free in search of the springs of life. A long walk is a rebirth of consciousness; one never returns quite the same, and is always better off for it.Written by"
58,Automated Keyword Extraction from Articles using NLP,"In research & news articles, keywords form an important component since they provide a concise representation of the article’s content. Keywords also play a crucial role in locating the article from information retrieval systems, bibliographic databases and for search engine optimization. Keywords also help to categorize the article into the relevant subject or discipline.Conventional approaches of extracting keywords involve manual assignment of keywords based on the article content and the authors’ judgment. This involves a lot of time & effort and also may not be accurate in terms of selecting the appropriate keywords. With the emergence of Natural Language Processing (NLP), keyword extraction has evolved into being effective as well as efficient.And in this article, we will combine the two — we’ll be applying NLP on a collection of articles (more on this below) to extract keywords.In this article, we will be extracting keywords from a dataset that contains about 3,800 abstracts. The original dataset is from Kaggle — NIPS Paper. Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) is one of the top machine learning conferences in the world. This dataset includes the title and abstracts for all NIPS papers to date (ranging from the first 1987 conference to the current 2016 conference).The original dataset also contains the article text. However, since the focus is on understanding the concept of keyword extraction and using the full article text could be computationally intensive, only abstracts have been used for NLP modelling. The same code block can be used on the full article text to get a better and enhanced keyword extraction.The dataset used for this article is a subset of the papers.csv dataset provided in the NIPS paper datasets on Kaggle. Only those rows that contain an abstract have been used. The title and abstract have been concatenated after which the file is saved as a tab separated *.txt file.As we can see, the dataset contains the article ID, year of publication and the abstract.Before we proceed with any text pre-processing, it is advisable to quickly explore the dataset in terms of word counts, most common and most uncommon words.The average word count is about 156 words per abstract. The word count ranges from a minimum of 27 to a maximum of 325. The word count is important to give us an indication of the size of the dataset that we are handling as well as the variation in word counts across the rows.A peek into the most common words gives insights not only on the frequently used words but also words that could also be potential data specific stop words. A comparison of the most common words and the default English stop words will give us a list of words that need to be added to a custom stop word list.Sparsity: In text mining, huge matrices are created based on word frequencies with many cells having zero values. This problem is called sparsity and is minimized using various techniques.Text pre-processing can be divided into two broad categories — noise removal & normalization. Data components that are redundant to the core text analytics can be considered as noise.Handling multiple occurrences / representations of the same word is called normalization. There are two types of normalization — stemming and lemmatization. Let us consider an example of various versions of the word learn — learn, learned, learning, learner. Normalisation will convert all these words to a single normalised version — “learn”.Stemming normalizes text by removing suffixes.Lemmatisation is a more advanced technique which works based on the root of the word.The following example illustrates the way stemming and lemmatisation work:To carry out text pre-processing on our dataset, we will first import the required libraries.Removing stopwords: Stop words include the large number of prepositions, pronouns, conjunctions etc in sentences. These words need to be removed before we analyse the text, so that the frequently used words are mainly the words relevant to the context and not common words used in the text.There is a default list of stopwords in python nltk library. In addition, we might want to add context specific stopwords for which the “most common words” that we listed in the beginning will be helpful. We will now see how to create a list of stopwords and how to add custom stopwords:We will now carry out the pre-processing tasks step-by-step to get a cleaned and normalised text corpus:Let us now view an item from the corpus:We will now visualize the text corpus that we created after pre-processing to get insights on the most frequently used words.Text in the corpus needs to be converted to a format that can be interpreted by the machine learning algorithms. There are 2 parts of this conversion — Tokenisation and Vectorisation.Tokenisation is the process of converting the continuous text into a list of words. The list of words is then converted to a matrix of integers by the process of vectorisation. Vectorisation is also called feature extraction.For text preparation we use the bag of words model which ignores the sequence of the words and only considers word frequencies.As the first step of conversion, we will use the CountVectoriser to tokenise the text and build a vocabulary of known words. We first create a variable “cv” of the CountVectoriser class, and then evoke the fit_transform function to learn and build the vocabulary.Let us now understand the parameters passed into the function:An encoded vector is returned with a length of the entire vocabulary.We can use the CountVectoriser to visualise the top 20 unigrams, bi-grams and tri-grams.The next step of refining the word counts is using the TF-IDF vectoriser. The deficiency of a mere word count obtained from the countVectoriser is that, large counts of certain common words may dilute the impact of more context specific words in the corpus. This is overcome by the TF-IDF vectoriser which penalizes words that appear several times across the document. TF-IDF are word frequency scores that highlight words that are more important to the context rather than those that appear frequently across documents.TF-IDF consists of 2 components:Based on the TF-IDF scores, we can extract the words with the highest scores to get the keywords for a document.Ideally for the IDF calculation to be effective, it should be based on a large corpora and a good representative of the text for which the keywords need to be extracted. In our example, if we use the full article text instead of the abstracts, the IDF extraction would be much more effective. However, considering the size of the dataset, I have limited the corpora to just the abstracts for the purpose of demonstration.This is a fairly simple approach to understand fundamental concepts of NLP and to provide a good hands-on practice with some python codes on a real-life use case. The same approach can be used to extract keywords from news feeds & social media feeds.Written by"
59,How to write with artificial intelligence,"In the past few days, I’ve taught a machine learning algorithm how to write in the style of Harry Potter, Hamilton (the musical), and HBO’s Silicon Valley. The mostly non-sensical, occasionally human-like, topically-flavored writing seems to be amusing not only to me, but to many others.“Dumbledore will get out from behind a cream cake” — Harry Potter: Written by Artificial IntelligenceThus, I’ve made this quick tutorial to teach you how to create your own instances of “Deep Writing”. This is not going to be an in-depth description of the underlying technology — but instead, a step-by-step guide that anybody can follow (even if you have no coding or machine learning experience).Here is a very crude approximation of what is involved in the Deep Writing process. More than anything, this is meant to give you enough intuition and appreciation to follow along with the rest of the tutorial.We are going to use code written by Sung Kim (who teaches computer science at HKUST). This code is very similar to the code I used, but is a little bit more generally applicable.Visit this link, click on the green “Clone or download button”, and then choose “Download Zip”.Find the zip file in your downloads folder, and double-click to unzip it. Drag the folder to your desktop.Open the file input.txt, which you can find in word-rnn-tensorflow-master > data > tinyshakespeare > input.txt. Then, delete all the text in the file, and replace it with the sample text that you want to use. Make sure you save the updated file.This sample text is the text that your algorithm will read and use as inspiration. For example, you can use the text of Harry Potter, the lyrics to Hamilton, the scripts from Silicon Valley, and so on.The longer the sample text, the “better” the output will be. Of course, the longer the sample text, the longer it will take to train your model. For comparison, the Harry Potter sample text was 467,678 words long.TensorFlow is a machine learning library made by Google. We need to download it in order to run our code.To do this, we will use the Terminal. To open the Terminal, click command + space, which will open “Spotlight Search”. Type “Terminal” and click enter.The terminal should open.Copy and paste the following line into the Terminal and click enter.Then, copy and paste this next line and click enter.These two line prepare your system to install TensorFlow.Then, copy the below line into the Terminal and click enter. This identifies which version of TensorFlow you want to install.Copy this final line and click enter. This will start the installation.After a few minutes, the installation will finish and you can now use TensorFlow on your computer.With TensorFlow downloaded on your computer, it’s time to train your model (i.e. “group” words based on patterns).To start, we want to let the computer know that we want to use TensorFlow. Copy and paste the line below into the Terminal and click enter.Now, we want to run the training file. To do this, we first need to tell the Terminal where the file is. Copy and paste the below line and click enter.Lastly, start the training file by copying and pasting the following line into the Terminal. Click enter and the training will begin.Training will take many hours (especially if your sample text is large). It will also drain your battery really fast, so make sure your computer is plugged in. While training, do not close the Terminal window and do not close your computer.Once your model finishes training, it’s finally time to create the Deep Writing.To prepare, open the file sample.py, which lives inside the folder word-rnn-tensorflow-master. Inside of the file, search for the line of code that says:Change the default value to the number of words you want in your instance of Deep Writing. I recommend something between 1000 and 2000.Once you make the change, save the updated file.Then, go back to the Terminal and copy and paste the following code.It will take a minute or two, and then the computer will spit out a beautiful instance of Deep Writing.With a little bit of formatting, it’s ready to be published.I created a publication on Medium to collect interesting examples of Deep Writing. If you create Deep Writing that you want to share, Tweet me a link, and I’ll added it the publication.If you are interested in learning more deeply about machine learning and the underlying math, here’s a good place to start.Written by"
